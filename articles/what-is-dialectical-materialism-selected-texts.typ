= The ABC of Materialist Dialectics

#v(-1em)

The dialectic is neither fiction nor mysticism, but a science of the forms of
our thinking insofar as it is not limited to the daily problems of life but
attempts to arrive at an understanding of more complicated and drawn-out
processes. The dialectic and formal logic bear a relationship similar to that
between higher and lower mathematics.

I will here attempt to sketch the substance of the problem in a very concise
form. The Aristotelian logic of the simple syllogism starts from the proposition
that A is equal to A. This postulate is accepted as an axiom for a multitude of
practical human actions and elementary generalisations. But in reality A is not
equal to A.

This is easy to prove if we observe these two letters under a lens - they are
quite different from each other.

But, one can object, the question is not of the size or the form of the letters,
since they are only symbols for equal quantities: for instance, a pound of
sugar.

The objection is beside the point; in reality a pound of sugar is never equal to
a pound of sugar - a more delicate scale always discloses a difference.

Again one can object: but a pound of sugar is equal to itself. Neither is this
true - all bodies change uninterruptedly in size, weight, colour, etc. They are
never equal to themselves.

A sophist will respond that a pound of sugar is equal to itself "at a given
moment." Aside from the extremely dubious practical value of this 'axiom,' it
does not withstand theoretical criticism either. How should we conceive the word
'moment'? If it is an infinitesimal interval of time, then a pound of sugar is
subjected during the course of that 'moment' to inevitable changes.

Or is the 'moment' a purely mathematical abstraction, that is, a zero of time?
But everything exists in time; and existence itself is an uninterrupted process
of transformation; time is consequently a fundamental element of existence.

Thus the axiom A is equal to A signifies that a thing is equal to itself if it
does not change, that is, if it does not exist.

At first glance it could seem that these "subtleties" are useless. In reality
they are of decisive significance. The axiom A is equal to A appears on one hand
to be the point of departure for all our knowledge, on the other hand the point
of departure for all the errors in our knowledge.

To make use of the axiom A is equal to A with impunity is possible only within
certain limits. When quantitative changes in A are negligible for the task at
hand, then we can presume A is equal to A. This is, for example, the manner in
which a buyer and a seller consider a pound of sugar.

We consider the temperature of the sun likewise. Until recently we considered
the buying power of the dollar in the same way. But quantitative changes beyond
certain limits become converted into qualitative. A pound of sugar subjected to
the action of water or kerosene ceases to be a pound of sugar. A dollar in the
embrace of a president ceases to be a dollar. To determine at the right moment
the critical point where quantity changes into quality is one of the most
important and difficult tasks in all the spheres of knowledge, including
sociology.

Every worker knows that it is impossible to make two completely equal objects.
In the elaboration of bearing-brass into cone bearings, a certain deviation is
allowed for the cones which should not, however, go beyond certain limits (this
is called tolerance). By observing the norms of tolerance, the cones are
considered as being equal (A is equal to A). When the tolerance is exceeded, the
quantity goes over into quality; in other words, the cone bearings become
inferior or completely worthless.

Our scientific thinking is only a part of our general practice, including
techniques. For concepts there also exists "tolerance" which is established not
by formal logic issuing from the axiom A is equal to A but by dialectical logic
issuing from the axiom that everything is always changing. "Common sense" is
characterized by the fact that it systematically exceeds dialectical
"tolerance."

Vulgar thought operates with such concepts as capitalism, morals, freedom,
workers' state, etc., as fixed abstractions, presuming that capitalism is equal
to capitalism, morals are equal to morals, etc. Dialectical thinking analyses
all things and phenomena in their continuous change, while determining in the
material conditions of those changes that critical limit beyond which A ceases
to be A, a workers' state ceases to be a workers' state.

The fundamental flaw of vulgar thought lies in the fact that it wishes to
content itself with motionless imprints of reality, which consists of eternal
motion. Dialectical thinking gives to concepts, by means of closer
approximations, corrections, concretisations, a richness of content and
flexibility, I would even say a succulence, which to a certain extent brings
them close to living phenomena. Not capitalism in general but a given capitalism
at a given stage of development. Not a workers' state in general, but a given
workers' state in a backward country in an Imperialist encirclement etc.

Dialectical thinking is related to vulgar thinking in the same way that a motion
picture is related to a still photograph. The motion picture does not outlaw the
still photograph but combines a series of them according to the laws of motion.
Dialectics does not deny the syllogism, but teaches us to combine syllogisms in
such a way as to bring our understanding closer to the eternally changing
reality.

Hegel in his Logic established a series of laws: change of quantity into
quality, development through contradictions, conflict of content and form,
interruption of continuity, change of possibility into inevitability, etc.,
which are just as important for theoretical thought as is the simple syllogism
for more elementary tasks.

Hegel wrote before Darwin and before Marx. Thanks to the powerful impulse given
to thought by the French Revolution, Hegel anticipated the general movement of
science. But because it was only an anticipation, although by a genius, it
received from Hegel an idealistic character. Hegel operated with ideological
shadows as the ultimate reality. Marx demonstrated that the movement of these
ideological shadows reflected nothing but the movement of material bodies.

We call our dialectic materialist since its roots are neither in heaven nor in
the depths of our "free will" but in objective reality, in nature. Consciousness
grew out of the unconscious, psychology out of physiology, the organic world out
of the inorganic, the solar system out of nebula.

On all the rungs of this ladder of development the quantitative changes were
transformed into qualitative. Our thought including dialectical thought is only
one of the forms of the expression of changing matter. There is place within
this system for neither God, nor Devil, nor immortal soul nor eternal norms of
laws and morals. The dialectic of thinking, having grown out of the dialectic of
nature, possesses consequently a thoroughly materialist character.

Darwinism, which explained the evolution of species through quantitative
transformations passing into qualitative, was the highest triumph of the
dialectic in the whole field of organic matter. Another great triumph was the
discovery of the table of atomic weights of chemical elements and further the
transformation of one element into another. With these transformations (species,
elements, etc.) is closely linked the question of classifications, just as
important in the natural as in the social sciences. Linnaeus's system
(eighteenth century), utilizing as its starting point the immutability of
species, was limited to the description and classification of plants according
to their external characteristics.

The infantile period of botany is analogous to the infantile period of logic,
since the forms of our thought develop like everything that lives. Only decisive
repudiation of the idea of fixed species, only the study of the history of the
evolution of plants and their anatomy prepared the basis for a really scientific
classification.

Marx, who in distinction from Darwin was a conscious dialectician, discovered a
basis for the scientific classification of human societies in the development of
their productive forces and the structure of the relations of ownership, which
constitute the anatomy of society. Marxism substituted for the vulgar
descriptive classification of societies and states, which even up to now still
flourishes in the universities, a materialistic dialectical classification. Only
through using the method of Marx is it possible correctly to determine both the
concept of a workers' state and the moment of its downfall.

All this, as we see, contains nothing "metaphysical" or "scholastic," as
conceited ignorance affirms. Dialectical logic expresses the laws of motion in
contemporary scientific thought. The struggle against materialist dialectics on
the contrary expresses a distant past conservatism of the petty bourgeoisie, the
self-conceit of university routinists and . . . a spark of hope for an
afterlife.

Out of the dissolution of the Hegelian school, however, there developed still
another tendency, the only one which has borne real fruit. And this tendency is
essentially connected with the name of Marx.

The separation from Hegelian philosophy was here also the result of a return to
the materialist standpoint. That means it was resolved to comprehend the real
world - nature and history - just as it presents itself to everyone who
approaches it free from preconceived idealist crotchets. It was decided
mercilessly to sacrifice every idealist which could not be brought into harmony
with the facts conceived in their own and not in a fantastic interconnection.
And materialism means nothing more than this. But here the materialistic world
outlook was taken really seriously for the first time and was carried through
consistently \- at least in its basic features - in all domains of knowledge
concerned.

Hegel was not simply put aside. On the contrary, a start was made from his
revolutionary side, described above, from the dialectical method. But in its
Hegelian form, this method was unusable. According to Hegel, dialectics is the
self-development of the concept. The absolute concept does not only exist -
unknown where - from eternity, it is also the actual living soul of the whole
existing world. It develops into itself through all the preliminary stages which
are treated at length in the Logic and which are all included in it. Then it
"alienates" itself by changing into nature, where, unconscious of itself,
disguised as a natural necessity, it goes through a new development and finally
returns as man's consciousness of himself. This self-consciousness then
elaborates itself again in history in the crude form until finally the absolute
concept again comes to itself completely in the Hegelian philosophy. According
to Hegel, therefore, the dialectical development apparent in nature and
history - that is, the causal interconnection of the progressive movement from
the lower to the higher, which asserts itself through all zigzag movements and
temporary retrogression - is only a copy \[Abklatsch\] of the self-movement of
the concept going on from eternity, no one knows where, but at all events
independently of any thinking human brain. This ideological perversion had to be
done away with. We again took a materialistic view of the thoughts in our heads,
regarding them as images \[Abbilder\] of real things instead of regarding real
things as images of this or that stage of the absolute concept. Thus dialectics
reduced itself to the science of the general laws of motion, both of the
external world and of human thought - two sets of laws which are identical in
substance, but differ in their expression in so far as the human mind can apply
them consciously, while in nature and also up to now for the most part in human
history, these laws assert themselves unconsciously, in the form of external
necessity, in the midst of an endless series of seeming accidents. Thereby the
dialectic of concepts itself became merely the conscious reflex of the
dialectical motion of the real world and thus the dialectic of Hegel was turned
over; or rather, turned off its head, on which it was standing, and placed upon
its feet. And this materialist dialectic, which for years has been our best
working tool and our sharpest weapon, was, remarkably enough, discovered not
only by us but also, independently of us and even of Hegel, by a German worker,
Joseph Dietzgen. (2)

In this way, however, the revolutionary side of Hegelian philosophy was again
taken up and at the same time freed from the idealist trimmings which with Hegel
had prevented its consistent execution. The great basic thought that the world
is not to be comprehended as a complex of readymade things, but as a complex of
processes, in which the things apparently stable no less than their mind images
in our heads, the concepts, go through an uninterrupted change of coming into
being and passing away, in which, in spite of all seeming accidentally and of
all temporary retrogression, a progressive development asserts itself in the
end - this great fundamental thought has, especially since the time of Hegel, so
thoroughly permeated ordinary consciousness that in this generality it is now
scarcely ever contradicted. But to acknowledge this fundamental thought in words
and to apply it in reality in detail to each domain of investigation are two
different things. If, however, investigation always proceeds from this
standpoint, the demand for final solutions and eternal truths ceases once for
all; one is always conscious of the necessary limitation of all acquired
knowledge, of the fact that it is conditioned by the circumstances in which it
was acquired. On the other hand, one no longer permits oneself to be imposed
upon by the antithesis, insuperable for the still common old metaphysics,
between true and false, good and bad, identical and different, necessary and
accidental. One knows that these antitheses have only a relative validity; that
that which is recognized now as true has also its latent false side which will
later manifest itself, just as that which is now regarded as false has also its
true side by virtue of which it could previously be regarded as true. One knows
that what is maintained to be necessary is composed of sheer accidents and that
the so-called accidental is the form behind which necessity hides itself - and
so on.

The old method of investigation and thought which Hegel calls "metaphysical",
which preferred to investigate things as given, as fixed and stable, a method
the relics of which still strongly haunt people's minds, had a great deal of
historical justification in its day. It was necessary first to examine things
before it was possible to examine processes. One had first to know what a
particular thing was before one could observe the changes it was undergoing. And
such was the case with natural science. The old metaphysics, which accepted
things as finished objects, arose from a natural science which investigated dead
and living things as finished objects. But when this investigation had
progressed so far that it became possible to take the decisive step forward,
that is, to pass on the systematic investigation of the changes which these
things undergo in nature itself, then the last hour of the old metaphysic struck
in the realm of philosophy also. And in fact, while natural science up to the
end of the last century was predominantly a collecting science, a science of
finished things, in our century it is essentially a systematizing science, a
science of the processes, of the origin and development of these things and of
the interconnection which binds all these natural processes into one great
whole. Physiology, which investigates the processes occurring in plant and
animal organisms; embryology, which deals with the development of individual
organisms from germs to maturity; geology, which investigates the gradual
formation of the Earth's surface - all these are the offspring of our century.

= The Three Sources and Component Parts of Marxism (extract)

The philosophy of Marxism is materialism. Throughout the recent history of
Europe, and particularly at the end of the eighteenth century in France, which
was the scene of the decisive battle against every kind of medieval rubbish,
against serfdom in institutions and ideas, materialism proved to be the only
consistent philosophy, true to all the teachings of natural science, hostile to
superstitions, cant, etc. The enemies of democracy tried, therefore, with all
their energy, to "overthrow," undermine and defame materialism, and defended
various forms of philosophic idealism, which always leads, in one way or
another, to the defence and support of religion.

Marx and Engels always defended philosophic materialism in the most determined
manner, and repeatedly explained the profound error of every deviation from this
basis. Their views are more dearly and fully expounded in the works of Engels,
Ludwig Feuerbach and Anti-Duhring, which, like the Communist Manifesto, are
household books for every conscious worker.

However, Marx did not stop at the materialism of the eighteenth century but
moved philosophy forward. He enriched it by the achievements of German classical
philosophy especially by Hegel's system, which in its turn had led to the
materialism of Feuerbach. Of these the main achievement is dialectics, i.e., the
doctrine of development in its fuller, deeper form, free from one-sidedness-the
doctrine, also, of the relativity of human knowledge that provides us with a
reflection of eternally developing matter. The latest discoveries of natural
science-radium, electrons, the transmutation of elements-are a remarkable
confirmation of the dialectical materialism of Marx, despite the doctrines of
bourgeois philosophers with their "new" returns to old and rotten idealism.

While deepening and developing philosophic materialism, Marx carried it to its
conclusion; he extended its perception of nature to the perception of human
society. The historical materialism of Marx represented the greatest conquest of
scientific thought.

Chaos and arbitrariness, which reigned until then in the views on history and
politics, were replaced by a strikingly consistent and harmonious scientific
theory, which shows how out of one order of social life another and higher order
develops, in consequence of the growth of the productive forces - how
capitalism, for instance, grows out of serfdom.

Just as the cognition of man reflects nature (i.e., developing matter) which
exists independently of him, so also the social cognition of man (i.e., the
various views and doctrines-philosophic, religious, political, etc.) reflects
the economic order of society. Political institutions are a superstructure on
the economic foundation. We see, for example, that the various political forms
of modern European states serve the purpose of strengthening the domination of
the bourgeoisie over the proletariat.

The philosophy of Marx completes in itself philosophic materialism which has
provided humanity, and especially the working class, with a powerful instrument
of knowledge.

= On the Question of Dialectics (Volume 38, p359)

The splitting of a single whole and the cognition of its contradictory parts is
the essence (one of the "essentials", one of the principal, if not the
principal, characteristics or features) of dialectics. That is precisely how
Hegel, too, puts the matter.

The correctness of this aspect of the content of dialectics must be tested by
the history of science. This aspect of dialectics (e.g.~in Plekhanov) usually
receives inadequate attention: the identity of opposites is taken as the
sum-total of examples ("for example, a seed", "for example, primitive
communism". The same is true of Engels. But it is "in the interests of
popularisation …") and not as a law of cognition (and as a law of the objective
world.)

In mathematics: + and -, differential and integral,

In mechanics: action and reaction,

In physics: positive and negative electricity,

In chemistry: the combination and dissociation of atoms,

In social science: the class struggle.

The identity of opposites (it would be more correct, perhaps, to say their
"unity", - although the difference between the terms identity and unity is not
particularly important here. In a certain sense both are correct) is the
recognition (discovery) of the contradictory, mutually exclusive, opposite
tendencies in all phenomena and processes of nature (including mind and
society). The condition for the knowledge of all processes of the world in their
"self-movement", in their spontaneous development, in their real life, is the
knowledge of them as a unity of opposites. Development is the "struggle" of
opposites. The two basic (or two possible? Or two historically observable?)
conceptions of development (evolution) are: development as decrease and
increase, as repetition, and development as a unity of opposites (the division
of a unity into mutually exclusive opposites and their reciprocal relation)! .

In the first conception of motion, self-movement, its driving force, its source,
its motive, remains in the shade (or this source is made external - God,
subject, etc.). In the second conception the chief attention is directed
precisely to knowledge of the source of "self"-movement.

The first conception is lifeless, pale and dry. The second is living. The second
alone furnishes the key to the "self-movement" of everything existing; it alone
furnishes the key to "leaps", to the "break in continuity," to the
transformation into the opposite”, to the destruction of the old and the
emergence of the new.

The unity (coincidence, identity, equal action) of opposites is conditional,
temporary, transitory, relative. The struggle of mutually exclusive opposites is
absolute, just as development and motion are absolute.

NB: The distinction between subjectivism (scepticism, sophistry, etc.) and
dialectics, incidentally, is that in (objective) dialectics the difference
between the relative and the absolute is itself relative. For objective
dialectics there is an absolute within the relative. For subjectivism and
sophistry the relative is only relative and excludes the absolute.

In his Capital, Marx first analyses the simplest, most ordinary and fundamental,
most common and everyday relation of bourgeois (commodity) society, a relation
encountered billions of times, viz., the exchange of commodities. In this very
simple phenomenon (in this "cell" of bourgeois society) analysis reveals all the
contradictions (or the germs of all contradictions) of modern society. The
subsequent exposition shows us the development (both growth and movement) of
these contradictions and of this society in the Sum of its individual parts.
From its beginning to its end.

Such must also be the method of exposition (or study) of dialectics in general
(for with Marx the dialectics of bourgeois society is only a particular case of
dialectics). To begin with what is the simplest, most ordinary, common, etc.,
with any proposition: the leaves of a tree are green; John is a man: Fido is a
dog, etc. Here already we have dialectics (as Hegel's genius recognised); the
individual is the universal.

Consequently, the opposites (the individual is opposed to the universal) are
identical: the individual exists only in the connection that leads to the
universal. The universal exists only in the individual and through the
individual. Every individual is (in one way or another) a universal. Every
universal is (a fragment, or an aspect, or the essence of) an individual. Every
universal only approximately embraces all the individual objects. Every
individual enters incompletely into the universal, etc., etc. Every individual
is connected by thousands of transitions with other kinds of individuals
(things, phenomena, processes) etc. Here already we have the elements, the
germs, the concepts of necessity, of objective connection in nature, etc. Here
already we have the contingent and the necessary, the phenomenon and the
essence; for when we say: John is a man, Fido is a dog, this is a leaf of a
tree, etc., we disregard a number of attributes as contingent; we separate the
essence from the appearance, and counterpose the one to the other.

Thus in any proposition we can (and must) disclose as in a "nucleus" (:cell”)
the germs of all the elements of dialectics, and thereby show that dialectics is
a property of all human knowledge in general.

And natural science shows us (and here again it must be demonstrated in any
simple instance) objective nature with the same qualities, the transformation of
the individual into the universal, of the contingent into the necessary,
transitions, modulations, and the reciprocal connection of opposites. Dialectics
is the theory of knowledge of (Hegel and) Marxism. This is the "aspect" of the
matter (it is not "an aspect" but the essence of the matter) to which Plekhanov,
not to speak of other Marxists, paid no attention.

Knowledge is represented in the form of a series of circles both by Hegel (see
Logic) and by the modern epistemologists” of natural science, the eclectic and
foe of Hegelianism (which he did not understand!!), Paul Volkmann.

]

Dialectics as living, many-sided knowledge (with the number of sides eternally
increasing), with an infinite number of shades of every approach and
approximation to reality (with a philosophical system growing into a whole out
of each shade) - here we have an immeasurably rich content as compared with
metaphysical materialism, the fundamental misfortune of which is its inability
to apply dialectics to the theory of reflection, to the process and development
of knowledge.

Philosophical idealism is only nonsense from the standpoint of crude, simple,
metaphysical materialism. From the standpoint of dialectical materialism, on the
other hand, philosophical idealism is a one-sided, exaggerated, development
(inflation, distension) of one of the features, aspects, facets of knowledge,
into an absolute, divorced from matter, from nature, apotheosised. Idealism is
clerical obscurantism. True. But philosophical idealism is ("more correctly" and
"in addition") a road to clerical obscurantism through one of the shades of the
infinitely complex knowledge (dialectical) of man.

Human knowledge is not (or does not follow) a straight line, but a curve, which
endlessly approximates a series of circles, a spiral. Any fragment, segment,
section of this curve can be transformed (transformed one-sidedly) into an
independent, complete, straight line, which then (if one does not see the wood
for the trees) leads into the quagmire, into clerical obscurantism (where it is
anchored by the class interests of the ruling classes). Rectilinearity and
one-sidedness, woodenness and petrification, subjectivism and subjective
blindness - voila the epistemological roots of idealism. And clerical
obscurantism (= philosophical idealism), of course, has epistemological roots,
it is not groundless; it is a sterile flower undoubtedly, but a sterile flower
that grows on the living tree of living, fertile, genuine, powerful, omnipotent,
objective, absolute human knowledge.

+ The determination of the concept out of itself \[the thing itself must be
  considered in its relations and in its development\];
+ the contradictory nature of the thing itself (the other of itself), the
  contradictory forces and tendencies in each phenomenon;
+ the union of analysis and synthesis.

Such apparently are the elements of dialectics. One could perhaps present these
elements in greater detail as follows:

+ the objectivity of consideration (not examples, not divergencies, but the
  Thing-in-itself).
+ the entire totality of the manifold relations of this thing to others.
+ the development of this thing, (phenomenon, respectively), its own movement,
  its own life.
+ the internally contradictory tendencies (and sides) in this thing.
+ the thing (phenomenon, etc) as the sum andunity of opposites.
+ the struggle, respectively unfolding, of these opposites, contradictory
  strivings, etc.
+ the union of analysis and synthesis - the breakdown of the separate parts and
  the totality, the summation of these parts.
+ the relations of each thing (phenomenon, etc.) are not only manifold, but
  general, universal. Each thing (phenomenon, etc.) is connected with every
  other.
+ not only the unity of opposites, but the transitions of every determination,
  quality, feature, side, property into every other \[into its opposite?\].
+ the endless process of the discovery of new sides, relations, etc.
+ the endless process of the deepening of man's knowledge of the thing, of
  phenomena, processes, etc., from appearance to essence and from less profound
  to more profound essence.
+ from co-existence to causality and from one form of connection and reciprocal
  dependence to another, deeper, more general form.
+ the repetition at a higher stage of certain features, properties, etc., of the
  lower and
+ the apparent return to the old (negation of the negation).
+ the struggle of content with form and conversely. The throwing off of the
  form, the transformation of the content.
+ the transition of quantity into quality and vice versa (15 and 16 are examples
  of 9)

In brief, dialectics can be defined as the doctrine of the unity of opposites.
This embodies the essence of dialectics, but it requires explanations and
development.
