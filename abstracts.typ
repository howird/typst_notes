= Self-Supervised Representation Learning from Video via Action-Conditioned Successor Representations

= How Can We Learn Goals

= Latent GCRL

+ how can we use latent observation predictions for GCRL

= Inverse GCRL instead of GAIL

- for Humanoid control, GAIL is always used which trains a discriminator as an
  additional reward
- how can we learn a reward function?

= explicit 3D spatial representations for as latent state
