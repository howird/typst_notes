= Introduction

Marxism, or Scientific Socialism, is the name given to the body of ideas
first worked out by Karl Marx (1818-1883) and Friedrich Engels
(1820-1895). In their totality, these ideas provide a fully worked-out
theoretical basis for the struggle of the working class to attain a
higher form of human society - socialism.

The study of Marxism falls under three main headings, corresponding
broadly to philosophy, social history and economics - Dialectical
Materialism, Historical Materialism and Marxist Economics. These are the
famous "Three component parts of Marxism" of which Lenin wrote.

The Education for Socialists series was launched to promote the study of
Marxism. They are intended to assist the student of Marxism by providing
an introduction to the subject matter, with suitable Marxist texts that
we hope will whet their appetite for further reading and study. In the
first of these Education for Socialists study guides, we provide a
selection of material on Dialectical Materialism. The other "component
parts", as well as other fundamental questions, will be dealt with in
future issues. The guides are suitable for individual study or as the
basis of a Marxist discussion group.

In beginning this study of Dialectical Materialism the editors are
publishing an introductory article by Rob Sewell. While this is a good
start to the subject, there is no substitute for proceeding from there
to tackle the philosophical works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Trotsky,
Plekhanov and others. Unfortunately Marx and Engels never wrote a
comprehensive work on dialectical materialism, although they intended to
do so. On his death, Engels left a pile of manuscripts, which he
intended to work up into an account of dialectics, or the laws of motion
of nature, human society and human thought. These were later published
as the Dialectics of Nature. Even in their rough, unfinished form these
notes give a brilliant insight into the method of Marxism and its
relation to the sciences.

The newer reader should not be put off by the sometimes difficult and
abstract ideas expressed in these writings. Whatever the initial
difficulty, a certain perseverance will pay just rewards. Marxism is a
science with its own terminology, and therefore makes heavy demands upon
the beginner. However, every serious worker and student knows that
nothing is worthwhile if attained without a degree of struggle and
sacrifice.

The theories of Marxism provide the thinking worker with a comprehensive
understanding. It is the duty of every worker and student to conquer for
himself or herself the theories of Marx and Engels, as an essential
prerequisite for the conquest of society by working people.

We recognise that there are real obstacles in the path of the worker's
struggle for theory. A man or woman who is obliged to toil long hours in
work, who has not had the benefit of a decent education and consequently
lacks the habit of reading, finds great difficulty in absorbing some of
the more complex ideas, especially at the outset. Yet it was for workers
that Marx and Engels wrote, and not for "clever" academics. "Every
beginning is difficult" no matter what science we are talking about. To
the class conscious worker who is prepared to persevere, one promise can
be made: once the initial effort is made to come to grips with
unfamiliar and new ideas, the theories of Marxism will be found to be
basically straight-forward and simple.

Once the basic concepts of Marxism are conquered, they open up a whole
new outlook on politics, the class struggle, and every aspect of life.

As a further introduction to dialectics, we are also republishing in
this issue Trotsky's ACB of Materialist Dialectics, also by Trotsky A
Triumph of Dialectical Materialism, an extract from Lenin's The Three
Sources and Three Components parts of Marxism, Lenin's Elements of
Dialectics, and an extract from Engels' Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of
Classical German Philosophy.

For further study, we recommend the following works by Engels,
especially chapters 12 and 13 in Anti-Duhring, the introduction to the
Dialectics of Nature, and Ludwig Feuerbach and the end of classical
German Philosophy.

Those who wish to go into greater depth should try reading Plekhanov's
The Monist View of History, Lenin's Materialism and Empirio-Criticism,
as well as his Philosophical Notebooks (Collected Works, Vol. 38).
Although these books are not an easy read, they are nonetheless very
rewarding if studied thoroughly.

= Do we need a philosophy?

Scientific socialism or Marxism is composed of three component parts:
Dialectical Materialism, Historical Materialism and Marxist Economics.
This pamphlet, the first in this series, is an introduction to the
concepts of Dialectical Materialism - the method of Marxism.

For those unacquainted with Marxist philosophy, dialectical materialism
may seem an obscure and difficult concept. However, for those prepared
to take the time to study this new way of looking at things, they will
discover a revolutionary outlook that will allow them an insight into
and understanding of the mysteries of the world in which we live. A
grasp of dialectical materialism is an essential prerequisite in
understanding the doctrine of Marxism. Dialectical materialism is the
philosophy of Marxism, which provides us with a scientific and
comprehensive world outlook. It is the philosophical bedrock - the
method - on which the whole of Marxist doctrine is founded.

According to Engels, dialectics was "our best working tool and our
sharpest weapon." And for us also, it is a guide to action and our
activities within the working class movement. It is similar to a compass
or map, which allows us to get our bearings in the turmoil of events,
and permits us to understand the underlying processes that shape our
world.

Whether we like it or not, consciously or unconsciously, everyone has a
philosophy. A philosophy is simply a way of looking at the world. Under
capitalism, without our own scientific philosophy, we will inevitably
adopt the dominant philosophy of the ruling class and the prejudices of
the society in which we live. "Things will never change" is a common
refrain, reflecting the futility of changing things and of the need to
accept our lot in life. There are other such proverbs as "There is
nothing new under the sun", and "History always repeats itself", which
reflect the same conservative outlook. Such ideas, explained Marx, form
a crushing weight on the consciousness of men and women.

Just as the emerging bourgeoisie in its revolution against feudal
society challenged the conservative ideas of the old feudal aristocracy,
so the working class, in its fight for a new society, needs to challenge
the dominant outlook of its own oppressor, the capitalist class. Of
course, the ruling class, through its monopoly control of the mass
media, the press, school, university and pulpit, consciously justifies
its system of exploitation as the most "natural form of society". The
repressive state machine, with its "armed bodies of men", is not
sufficient to maintain the capitalist system. The dominant ideas and
morality of bourgeois society serve as a vital defence of the material
interests of the ruling class. Without this powerful ideology, the
capitalist system could not last for any length of time.

#quote(block: true)[
  "In one way or another," states Lenin, "all official and liberal science
  defends wage-slavery… To expect science to be impartial in a wage-slave
  society is as foolishly naïve as to expect impartiality from
  manufacturers on the question of whether workers' wages ought not to be
  increased by decreasing the profits of capital."
]

Official bourgeois ideology conducts a relentless war against Marxism,
which it correctly sees as a mortal danger to capitalism. The bourgeois
scribes and professors pour out a continual stream of propaganda in an
attempt to discredit Marxism - particularly the dialectic. This has
especially been the case since the collapse of the Berlin Wall, and the
ferocious ideological offensive against Marxism, communism, revolution,
and such like. "Marxism is dead", they repeatedly proclaim like some
religious incantation. But Marxism refuses to lie down in front of these
witch doctors! Marxism reflects the unconscious will of the working
class to change society. Its fate is linked to that of the proletariat.

The apologists of capitalism, together with their shadows in the labour
movement, constantly assert that their system is a natural and permanent
form of society. On the other hand, the dialect asserts that nothing is
permanent and all things perish in time. Such a revolutionary philosophy
constitutes a profound threat to the capitalist system and therefore
must be discredited at all cost. This explains the daily churning out of
anti-Marxist propaganda. But each real step forward in science and
knowledge serves to confirm the correctness of the dialectic. For
millions of people the growing crisis of capitalism increasingly
demonstrates the validity of Marxism. The objective situation is forcing
working people to seek a way out of the impasse. "Life teaches",
remarked Lenin. Today, to use the famous words of the Communist
Manifesto, "A spectre is haunting Europe, the spectre of communism."

In the fight for the emancipation of the working class, Marxism also
wages a relentless war against capitalism and its ideology, which
defends and justifies its system of exploitation, the "market economy".
But Marxism does more than this. Marxism provides the working class with
"an integral world outlook irreconcilable with any form of superstition,
reaction, or defence of bourgeois oppression." (Lenin) It seeks to
reveal the real relationships that exist under capitalism and arms the
working class with an understanding of how it can achieve its own
emancipation. Dialectical materialism, to use the words of the Russian
Marxist Plekhanov, is more than an outlook, it is a "philosophy of
action."

= The Limits of Formal Logic

Men and women attempt to think in a rational manner. Logic (from the
Greek logos, meaning word or reason) is the science of the laws of
thinking. Whatever thoughts we think, and whatever language they are
expressed in, they must satisfy the requirements of reasoning. These
requirements give rise to laws of thought, to the principles of logic.
It was the Greek philosopher Aristotle (384 - 322BC) more than 2,000
years ago who formulated the present system of formal logic - a system
that is the basis of our educational establishments to this very day. He
categorised the method of how we should reason correctly and how
statements are combined to arrive at judgements, and from them, how
conclusions are drawn. He laid down three basic laws of logic: the
principle of Identity (A = A), of contradiction (A cannot be A and
not-A), and the excluded middle (A is either A or non-A; there is no
middle alternative).

Formal logic has held sway for more than two millennia and was the basis
of experiment and the great advances of modern science. The development
of mathematics was based on this logic. You cannot teach a child to add
up without it. One plus one equals two, not three. Formal logic may seem
like common sense and is responsible for the execution of a million and
one everyday things, but - and this is the big but - it has its limits.
When dealing with drawn out processes or complicated events, formal
logic becomes a totally inadequate way of thinking. This is particularly
the case in dealing with movement, change and contradiction. Formal
logic regards things as fixed and motionless. Of course, this is not to
deny the everyday usefulness of formal logic, on the contrary, but we
need to recognise it limits.

#quote(block: true)[
  "The dialectic is neither fiction or mysticism," wrote Leon Trotsky,
  "but a science of the forms of our thinking insofar as it is not limited
  to the daily problems of life but attempts to arrive at an understanding
  of more complicated and drawn-out processes. The dialectic and formal
  logic bear a relationship similar to that between higher and lower
  mathematics." (The ABC of Materialist Dialectics)
]

With the development of modern science, the system of classification (of
Linnaeus) was based on formal logic, where all living things were
divided into species and orders. This constituted a great leap forward
for biology compared to the past. However, it was a fixed and rigid
system, with its rigid categories, which over time revealed its limits.
Darwin in particular showed that through evolution it was possible for
one species to be transformed into another species. Consequently, the
rigid system of classification had to be changed to allow for this new
understanding of reality.

In effect, the system of formal logic broke down. It could not cope with
these contradictions. On the other hand, dialectics - the logic of
change - explains that there are no absolute or fixed categories in
nature or society. Engels had great fun in pointing to the duck-billed
platypus, this transitional form, and asking where it fitted into the
rigid scheme of things!

Only dialectical materialism can explain the laws of evolution and
change, which sees the world not as a complex of ready-made things, but
as a complex of processes, which go through an uninterrupted
transformation of coming into being and passing away. For Hegel, the old
logic was exactly like a child's game, which sought to make pictures out
of jigsaw pieces. "The fundamental flaw in vulgar thought", wrote
Trotsky, "lies in the fact that it wishes to content itself with
motionless imprints of reality which consists of eternal motion."

Before we look at the main laws of dialectical materialism, let us take
a look at the origins of the materialist outlook.

= Materialism versus idealism

"The philosophy of Marxism is materialism", wrote Lenin. Philosophy
itself fits into two great ideological camps: materialism and idealism.
Before we proceed, even these terms need an explanation. To begin with,
materialism and idealism have nothing whatsoever in common with their
everyday usage, where materialism is associated with material greed and
swindling (in short, the morality of present-day capitalism) and
idealism with high ideals and virtue. Far from it!

Philosophical materialism is the outlook which explains that there is
only one material world. There is no Heaven or Hell. The universe, which
has always existed and is not the creation of any supernatural being, is
in the process of constant flux. Human beings are a part of nature, and
evolved from lower forms of life, whose origins sprung from a lifeless
planet some 3.6 billion or so years ago. With the evolution of life, at
a certain stage, came the development of animals with a nervous system,
and eventually human beings with a large brain. With humans emerged
human thought and consciousness. The human brain alone is capable of
producing general ideas, i.e., thinking. Therefore matter, which existed
eternally, existed and still exists independently of the mind and human
beings. Things existed long before any awareness of them arose or could
have arisen on the part of living organisms.

For materialists there is no consciousness apart from the living brain,
which is part of a material body. A mind without a body is an absurdity.
Matter is not a product of mind, but mind itself is the highest product
of matter. Ideas are simply a reflection of the independent material
world that surrounds us. Things reflected in a mirror do not depend on
this reflection for their existence. "All ideas are taken from
experience, are reflections - true or distorted - of reality," states
Engels. Or to use the words of Marx, "Life is not determined by
consciousness, but consciousness by life."

Marxists do not deny that mind, consciousness, thought, will, feeling or
sensation are real. What materialists deny is that the thing called "the
mind" exists separately from the body. Mind is not distinct from the
body. Thinking is the product of the brain, which is the organ of
thought.

Yet this does not mean that our consciousness is a lifeless mirror of
nature. Human beings relate to their surroundings; they are aware of
their surroundings and react accordingly; in turn, the environment
reacts back upon them. While rooted in material conditions, human beings
generalise and think creatively. They in turn change their material
surroundings.

On the other hand, philosophical idealism states that the material world
is not real but is simply the reflection of the world of ideas. There
are different forms of idealism, but all essentially explain that ideas
are primary and matter, if it exists at all, secondary. For the
idealists, ideas are dissevered from matter, from nature. This is
Hegel's conception of the Absolute Idea or what amounts to God.
Philosophical idealism opens the road, in one way or another, to the
defence of or support for religion and superstition. Not only is this
outlook false, it is also profoundly conservative, leading us to the
pessimistic conclusion that we can never understand the "mysterious
ways" of the world. Whereas materialism understands that human beings
not only observe the real world, but can change it, and in doing so,
change themselves.

The idealist view of the world grew out of the division of labour
between physical and mental labour. This division constituted an
enormous advance as it freed a section of society from physical work and
allowed them the time to develop science and technology. However, the
further removed from physical labour, the more abstract became their
ideas. And when thinkers separate their ideas from the real world, they
become increasingly consumed by abstract "pure thought" and end up with
all types of fantasies. Today, cosmology is dominated by complex
abstract mathematical conceptions, which have led to all sorts of weird
and wonderful erroneous theories: the Big Bang, beginning of time,
parallel universes, etc. Every break with practice leads to a one-sided
idealism.

The materialist outlook has a long history stretching back to the
ancient Greeks of Anaxagoras (c.500 - 428 BC) and Democritus (c.460 -
c.370 BC). With the collapse of Ancient Greece, this rational outlook
was cut across for a whole historical epoch, and only after the
reawakening of thought following the demise of the Christian Middle Ages
was there a revival of philosophy and natural science. From the
seventeenth century, the home of modern materialism was England. "The
real progenitor of English materialism is Bacon," wrote Marx. The
materialism of Francis Bacon (1561 - 1626) was then systemised and
developed by Thomas Hobbes (1588 - 1679), whose ideas were in turn
developed by John Locke (1632 - 1704). The latter already thought it
possible that matter could posses the faculty of thinking. It is no
accident that these advances in human thought coincided with the rise of
the bourgeoisie and great advances in science, particularly mechanics,
astronomy and medicine. These great thinkers in turn provided the
breakthrough for the brilliant school of French materialists of the
eighteenth century, most notably René Descartes (1596 - 1650).

It was their materialism and rationalism that became the creed of the
Great French Revolution of 1789. These revolutionary thinkers recognised
no external authority. Everything from religion to natural science, from
society to political institutions, was subjected to the most searching
criticism. Reason became the measure of everything.

This materialist philosophy, consistently championed by Holbach (1723 -
1789) and Helvetius, was a revolutionary philosophy. "The universe is
the vast unity of everything that is, everywhere it shows us only matter
in movement," states Holbach. "This is all that there is and it displays
only an infinite and continuous chain of causes and actions; some of
these causes we know, since they immediately strike our senses; others
we do not know since they act on us only by means of consequences, quite
remote from first causes."

This rational philosophy was an ideological reflection of the
revolutionary bourgeoisie's struggle against the church, the aristocracy
and the absolute monarchy. It represented a fierce attack on the
ideology of the Old Order. In the end, the kingdom of Reason became
nothing more than the idealised kingdom of the bourgeoisie. Bourgeois
property became one of the essential rights of man. The revolutionary
materialists paved the way for the new bourgeois society and the
domination of new private property forms. "Different times, different
circumstances, a different philosophy," stated Denis Diderot (1713 -
1784).

The new materialism, although a revolutionary advance, tended to be very
rigid and mechanical. These new philosophers attacked the church and
denied the self-sufficiency of the soul and held that man was simply a
material body as all other animals and inorganic bodies. Man was
regarded as a more complex and more delicate mechanism than other
bodies. According to Denis Diderot, in his conversation with D'Alembert,
"We are instruments endowed with feeling and memory."

For the French materialists the origin of knowledge - the discovery of
objective truth - lay through the action of nature on our senses. The
planets and man's place within the solar system and nature itself was
fixed. For them, it was a clockwork world, where everything had its
logical static place, and where the impulse for movement came from
outside. The whole approach, while materialist, was mechanical, and
failed to grasp the living reality of the world. It could not grasp the
universe as a process, as matter undergoing continuous change. This
weakness led to the false dichotomy between the material world and the
world of ideas. And this dualism opened the door to idealism.

Others held to a monist view that the universe was one system which was
not pure spirit or pure matter. Spinoza was the first to work out such a
system. While he saw the need for a God, the universe was one system,
which was wholly material from end to end.

= Dialectics and Metaphysics

The Marxist view of the world is not only materialist, but also
dialectical. For its critics, the dialectic is portrayed as something
totally mystical, and therefore irrelevant. But this is certainly not
the case. The dialectical method is simply an attempt to understand more
clearly our real interdependent world. Dialectics, states Engels in
Anti-Duhring, "is nothing more than the science of the general laws of
motion and development of nature, human society and thought." Put
simply, it is the logic of motion.

It is obvious to most people that we do not live in a static world. In
fact, everything in nature is in a state of constant change. "Motion is
the mode of existence of matter," states Engels. "Never anywhere has
there been matter without motion, nor can there be." The earth revolves
continually around its axis, and in turn itself revolves around the sun.
This results in day and night, and the different seasons that we
experience throughout the year. We are born, grow up, grow old and
eventually die. Everything is moving, changing, either rising and
developing or declining and dying away. Any equilibrium is only
relative, and only has meaning in relation to other forms of motion.

#quote(block: true)[
  "When we consider and reflect upon nature at large or the history of
  mankind or our own intellectual activity, at first we see the picture of
  an endless entanglement of relations and reactions, permutations and
  combinations, in which nothing remains what, where, and as it was, but
  everything moves, changes, comes into being, and passes away," remarks
  Engels. "We see, therefore, at first the picture as a whole, with its
  individual parts still more or less kept in the background; we observe
  the movements, transitions, connections rather than the things that
  move, combine, and are connected. This primitive, naïve but
  intrinsically correct conception of the world is that of ancient Greek
  philosophy, and was first clearly formulated by Heraclitus: everything
  is and is not, for everything is fluid, is constantly changing,
  constantly coming into being and passing away."
]

The Greeks made a whole series of revolutionary discoveries and advances
in natural science. Anaximander made a map of the world, and wrote a
book on cosmology, from which only a few fragments survive. The
Antikythera mechanism, as it is called, appears to be the remains of a
clockwork planetarium dating back to the first century BC. Given the
limited knowledge of the time, many were anticipations and inspired
guesses. Under slave society, these brilliant inventions could not be
put to productive use and were simply regarded as playthings for
amusement. The real advances in natural science took place in the
mid-fifteenth century. The new methods of investigation meant the
division of nature into its individual parts, allowing objects and
processes to be classified. While this provided massive amount of data,
objects were analysed in isolation and not in their living environment.
This produced a narrow, rigid, metaphysical mode of thought that has
become the hallmark of empiricism. "The Facts" became the all important
feature. "Now, what I want is, Facts. Teach these boys and girls nothing
but Facts. Facts alone are wanted in life," states the Dickensian
character Thomas Gradgrind in Hard Times.

"To the metaphysician things and their mental reflexes, ideas, are
isolated, are to be considered one after the other and apart from each
other, are objects of investigation fixed, rigid, given once and for
all", states Engels. “He thinks in absolutely irreconcilable antitheses.
'His communication is "yea, yea; nay, nay"; for whatsoever is more than
these cometh of evil.' For him a thing either exists or does not exist;
a thing cannot at the same time be itself and something else. Positive
and negative absolutely exclude one another; cause and effect stand in
rigid antithesis one to another.

#quote(block: true)[
  "At first sight this mode of thinking seems to us very luminous, because
  it is that of so-called sound common sense. Only sound common sense,
  respectable fellow that he is, in the homely realm of his own four
  walls, has very wonderful adventures directly he ventures out into the
  wide world of research. And the metaphysical mode of thought,
  justifiable and necessary as it is in a number of domains whose extent
  varies according to the nature of the particular object of
  investigation, sooner or later reaches a limit beyond which it becomes
  one-sided, restricted, abstract, lost in insoluble contradictions. In
  the contemplation of individual things it forgets the connection between
  them; in the contemplation of their existence it forgets the beginning
  and the end of that existence; of their repose, it forgets their motion.
  It cannot see the wood for the trees."
]

Engels goes on to explain that for everyday purposes we know whether an
animal is alive or not. But upon closer examination, we are forced to
recognise that is not a simple straightforward question. On the
contrary, it is a complex question. There are raging debates even today
as to when life begins in the mothers' womb. Likewise, it is just as
difficult to say when the exact moment of death occurs, as physiology
proves that death is not a single instantaneous act, but a protracted
process. In the brilliant words of the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, "It
is the same thing in us that is living and dead, asleep and awake, young
and old; each changes place and becomes the other. We step and we do not
step into the same stream; we are and we are not."

Not everything is as appears on the surface of things. Every species,
every aspect of organic life, is every moment the same and not the same.
It develops by assimilating matter from without and simultaneously
discards other unwanted matter; continually some cells die, while others
are renewed. Over time, the body is completely transformed, renewed from
top to bottom. Therefore, every organic entity is both itself and yet
something other than itself.

This phenomenon cannot be explained by metaphysical thought or formal
logic. This approach is incapable of explaining contradiction. This
contradictory reality does not enter the realm of common sense
reasoning. Dialectics, on the other hand, comprehends things in their
connection, development, and motion. As far as Engels was concerned,
"Nature is the proof of dialectics."

Here is how Engels described the rich processes of change in his book
the Dialectics of Nature:

#quote(block: true)[
  "Matter moves in an eternal cycle, completing its trajectory in a period
  so vast that in comparison with it our earthly year is as nothing; in a
  cycle in which the period of highest development, namely the period of
  organic life with its crowning achievement - self-consciousness, is a
  space just as comparatively minute in the history of life and
  self-consciousness; in a cycle in which every particular form of the
  existence of matter - be it the sun or a nebular, a particular animal or
  animal-species, a chemical combination or decomposition - is equally in
  transition; in a cycle in which nothing is eternal, except eternally
  changing, eternally moving matter and the laws of its movement and
  change. But however often and pitilessly this cycle may be accomplished
  in time and space, however many countless suns and earths may arise and
  fall, however long it may be necessary to wait until in some solar
  system, on some planet appear conditions suitable for organic life,
  however many countless beings may fall and rise before, out of their
  midst, develop animals with a thinking brain that find an environment
  that permits them to live, be it even only for a short period, we are,
  nevertheless, assured that matter in all its changes remains eternally
  one and the same, that not one of its attributes may perish, and that
  that same iron necessity which compels the destruction of the highest
  early bloom of matter - the thinking spirit - also necessitates its
  rebirth at some other place, at some other time."

  Along with, and following the French philosophy of the eighteenth
  century, arose a new radical German philosophy. Through Emmanuel Kant,
  the culmination of this philosophy was epitomised by the system of
  George F. Hegel, who had greatly admired the French Revolution. Hegel,
  although an idealist, was the most encyclopaedic mind of his age. The
  great contribution of this genius was the rescuing of the dialectical
  mode of thought originally developed by the ancient Greek philosophers
  some 2,000 years before.

  "Changes in being consist not only in the fact that one quantity passes
  into another quantity, but also that quality passes into quantity, and
  vice versa," wrote Hegel. "Each transition of the latter kind represents
  an interruption, and gives the phenomenon a new aspect, qualitatively
  distinct from the previous one. Thus water when cooled grows hard, not
  gradually… but all at once; having already cooled to freezing-point, it
  can still remain a liquid only if preserves a tranquil condition, and
  then the slightest shock is sufficient for it suddenly to become hard…
  In the world of moral phenomena… there take place the same changes of
  quantitative into qualitative, and differences in qualities there also
  are founded upon quantitative differences. Thus, a little less, a little
  more constitutes that limit beyond which frivolity ceases and there
  appears something quite different, crime…" (Science of Logic)
]

Hegel's works are full of references and examples of dialectics.
Unfortunately, Hegel was not only an idealist, but wrote in the most
obscure and abstruse fashion imaginable, making his works very difficult
to read. Lenin, while re-reading Hegel in exile during the First World
War, wrote: "I am in general trying to read Hegel materialistically:
Hegel is materialism which has been stood on its head (according to
Engels) - that is to say, I cast aside for the most part God, the
Absolute, the Pure Idea, etc." Lenin was greatly impressed by Hegel,
and, despite his idealism, later recommended that young communists study
his writings for themselves.

The young Marx and Engels were followers of the great Hegel. They
learned a colossal amount from this teacher. He opened their eyes to a
new outlook on the world epitomised by the dialectic. By embracing the
dialectic, Hegel freed history from metaphysics. For the dialectic,
there is nothing final, absolute, or sacred. It reveals the transitory
character of everything. However, Hegel was limited by his knowledge,
the knowledge of his age, and the fact he was an idealist. He regarded
thoughts within the brain not as more or less abstract pictures of real
things and processes, but as realisations of the "Absolute Idea",
existing from eternity. Hegel's idealism turned reality on its head.

Nevertheless, Hegel systematically outlined the important laws of
change, touched upon earlier.

= The law of quantity into quality (and vice versa)

#quote(block: true)[
  "It has been said that there are no sudden leaps in nature, and it is a
  common notion that things have their origin through gradual increase or
  decrease," states Hegel. "But there is also such a thing as sudden
  transformation from quantity to quality. For example, water does not
  become gradually hard on cooling, becoming first pulpy and ultimately
  attaining a rigidity of ice, but turns hard at once. If temperature be
  lowered to a certain degree, the water is suddenly changed into ice,
  i.e., the quantity - the number of degrees of temperature - is
  transformed into quality - a change in the nature of the thing." (Logic)
]

This is the cornerstone of understanding change. Change or evolution
does not take place gradually in a straight smooth line. Marx compared
the social revolution to an old mole burrowing busily beneath the
ground, invisible for long periods, but steadily undermining the old
order and later emerging into the light in a sudden overturn. Even
Charles Darwin believed that his theory of evolution was essentially
gradual and that the gaps in the fossil record did not represent any
breaks or leaps in evolution, and would be "filled in" by further
discoveries. In this Darwin was wrong. Today, new theories, essentially
dialectical, have been put forward to explain the leaps in evolution.
Stephen J. Gould and Niles Eldredge termed their dialectical theory of
evolution "punctuated equilibria". They explained that there were long
periods of evolution where there were no apparent changes taking place,
then suddenly, a new life form or forms emerged. In other words,
quantitative differences gave rise to a qualitative change, leading to
new species. The whole of development is characterised by breaks in
continuity, leaps, catastrophes and revolutions.

The emergence of single-cellular life in the earth's oceans some 3.6
billion years ago was a qualitative leap in the evolution of matter. The
"Cambrian explosion", some 600 million years ago, where complex
multicellular life with hard parts exploded onto the scene was a further
qualitative leap forward in evolution. In the lower Palaeozoic, some 400
to 500 million years ago, the first vertebrate fish emerged. This
revolutionary design became dominant and advanced through the amphibians
(which lived both in water and on land), through reptiles, and finally
branched off into warm-blooded creatures: birds and mammals. Such
revolutionary leaps culminated in human beings that have the capacity to
think. Evolution is a long process whereby an accumulation of changes
inside and outside the organism leads to a leap, a qualitatively higher
state of development.

Just as colossal subterranean pressures that accumulate and periodically
break through the earth's crust in the form of earthquakes, so gradual
changes in the consciousness of workers lead to an explosion in the
class struggle. A strike in a factory is not caused by outside
"agitators", but is produced by an accumulation of changes within the
factory that finally pushes the workforce to strike. The "cause" of the
strike maybe something quite small and incidental, a tea-break for
instance, but it has become "the last straw that breaks the camel's
back", to use a popular (dialectical) expression. It has become the
catalyst whereby quantity changes into quality.

Today, a whole series of left wing electoral victories within the
British trade unions are a product of a long accumulation of discontent
within the union rank and file. Twenty years of bitter attacks on the
working class has resulted in these changes at the top of the trade
unions. Only those armed with a Marxist philosophy could foresee this
development, which is rooted in the changing objective situation. These
changes of mood, which are already taking place in the trade unions,
will inevitably be reflected within the Labour Party at a certain stage
that will result in the demise of the right wing under Blair. The
ultra-lefts on the fringes of the Labour movement have continually
written off the Labour Party as something that could never be changed.
They are incapable of thinking dialectically, and have an empirical and
formalistic outlook that only sees the surface of reality. They fail to
draw a distinction between appearance and reality - between the
immediate appearance evident to observation and the hidden processes,
interconnections and laws that underlie the observed facts. In other
words, they are blind to the subterranean processes taking place before
their very eyes. "Blairism dominates the Labour Party!" they exclaim and
throw up their hands in despair. They are under the spell of formal
logic, and do not understand the process at work that will inevitably
undermine Blairism, and lead to its collapse, as night follows day. As
they wrote off the right wing unions in the past, they write off the
Labour Party today. On the basis of events and the pressures of the
leftward moving trade union movement, the Labour Party, given its roots
in the trade unions, will inevitably move in a similar direction.

Marx stressed that the task of science is always to proceed from the
immediate knowledge of appearances to the discovery of reality, of the
essence, of the laws underlying the appearances. Marx's Capital is a
fine example of this method. "The way of thinking of the vulgar
economists", wrote Marx to Engels, "derives from the fact that it is
always only the immediate form in which relationships appear which is
reflected in the brain, and not their inner connections." (June 27,
1867)

The same could be said of those who in the past wrote off the Soviet
Union as "state capitalist". Stalinism had nothing in common with
socialism; it was a repressive regime, where workers had less rights
than in the west. However, instead of a scientific analysis of the
Soviet Union, they simply pronounced it state capitalist. As Trotsky
explained the theorists of state capitalism looked at the USSR through
the eyes of formal logic. It was either-or, black or white. The USSR was
either a wonderful socialist state, as the Stalinists said, or it must
be a (state) capitalist state. Such thinking is pure formalism. They
never understood the possibility of a degeneration of the workers' state
into a chronically deformed variant of proletarian rule, as explained by
Trotsky. It is clear that the revolution, due to its isolation in a
backward country, went through a process of degeneration. However, while
the nationalised planned economy remained, not everything was lost. The
bureaucracy was not a new ruling class, but a parasitic growth on the
state, which usurped political power. Only a new political revolution
could eliminate the bureaucracy and reintroduce soviets and workers'
democracy.

The supporters of state capitalism tied themselves in knots, confusing
counterrevolution with revolution and vice versa. In Afghanistan, they
supported the reactionary fundamentalist mujahideen as "freedom
fighters" against Russian "imperialism". With the collapse of the USSR
and the move to restore capitalism from 1991 onwards, they remained
neutral in face of real capitalist counterrevolution.

= The unity of Opposites

#quote(block: true)[
  ~"The contradiction, however, is the source of all movement and life;
  only in so far as it contains a contradiction can anything have
  movement, power, and effect." (Hegel). "In brief", states Lenin,
  "dialectics can be defined as the doctrine of the unity of opposites.
  This embodies the essence of dialectics…"
]

The world in which we live is a unity of contradictions or a unity of
opposites: cold-heat, light-darkness, Capital-Labour, birth-death,
riches-poverty, positive-negative, boom-slump, thinking-being,
finite-infinite, repulsion-attraction, left-right, above-below,
evolution-revolution, chance-necessity, sale-purchase, and so on.

The fact that two poles of a contradictory antithesis can manage to
coexist as a whole is regarded in popular wisdom as a paradox. The
paradox is a recognition that two contradictory, or opposite,
considerations may both be true. This is a reflection in thought of a
unity of opposites in the material world.

Motion, space and time are nothing else but the mode of existence of
matter. Motion, as we have explained is a contradiction, - being in one
place and another at the same time. It is a unity of opposites.
"Movement means to be in this place and not to be in it; this is the
continuity of space and time - and it is this which first makes motion
possible." (Hegel)

To understand something, its essence, it is necessary to seek out these
internal contradictions. Under certain circumstances, the universal is
the individual, and the individual is the universal. That things turn
into their opposites, - cause can become effect and effect can become
cause - is because they are merely links in the never-ending chain in
the development of matter.

"The negative is to an equal extent positive," states Hegel. Dialectical
thought is "comprehending the antithesis in its unity." In fact Hegel
goes further:

#quote(block: true)[
  "Contradiction is the root of all movement and vitality, and it is only
  insofar as it contains a Contradiction that anything moves and has
  impulse and activity…Something moves, not because it is here at one
  point of time and there at another, but because at one and the same
  point of time it is here and not here, and in this here both is and is
  not. We must grant the old dialecticians the contradictions which they
  prove in motion; but what follows is not that there is no motion, but
  rather that motion is existent Contradiction itself." Therefore for
  Hegel, something is living insofar as it contains contradiction, which
  provides it with self-movement.

The Greek atomists first advanced the revolutionary theory that the
material world was made up of atoms, considered the smallest unit of
matter. The Greek word atomos means indivisible. This was a brilliant
intuitive guess. Twentieth century science proved that everything was
composed of atoms, although it was subsequently discovered that even
smaller particles existed. Every atom contains a nucleus at its centre,
composed of sub-atomic particles called protons and neutrons. Orbiting
around the nucleus are particles known as electrons. All protons carry a
positive electrical charge, and would therefore repel each other, but
they are bound together by a type of energy known as the strong nuclear
force. This shows that everything that exists is based on a unity of
opposites and has self-movement of "impulse and activity", to use
Hegel's words.

In humans, the level of blood sugar is essential for life. Too high a
level is likely to result in diabetic coma, too little and the person is
incapable of eating. This safe level is regulated by the rate at which
sugar is released into the bloodstream by the digestion of
carbohydrates, the rate at which stored glycogen, fat or protein is
converted into sugar, and the rate at which sugar is removed and
utilised. If the blood sugar level rises, then the rate of utilisation
is increased by the release of more insulin from the pancreas. If it
falls, more sugar is released into the blood, or the person gets hungry
and consumes a source of sugar. In this self-regulation of opposing
forces, of positive and negative feedbacks, the blood sugar level is
kept within tolerable limits.

Lenin explains this self-movement in a note when he says, "Dialectics is
the teaching which shows how opposites can be and how they become
identical - under what conditions they are identical, becoming
transformed into one another - why the human mind should grasp these
opposites not as dead, rigid, but living, conditional, mobile, becoming
transformed into one another."

Lenin also laid great stress on the importance of contradiction as the
motive force of development.

#quote(block: true)[
  "It is common knowledge that, in any given society, the strivings of
  some of its members conflict with the strivings of others, that social
  life is full of contradictions, and that history reveals a struggle
  between nations and societies, as well as within nations and societies,
  and, besides, an alternation of periods of revolution and reaction,
  peace and war, stagnation and rapid progress or decline." (Lenin).
]

This is best illustrated by the class struggle. Capitalism requires a
capitalist class and a working class. The struggle over the surplus
value created by the workers and expropriated by the capitalists leads
to an irreconcilable struggle that will provide the basis for the
eventual overthrow of capitalism, and the resolution of the
contradiction through the abolition of classes.

= The Negation of the Negation

The general pattern of historical development is not one of a straight
line upward, but of a complex interaction in which each step forward is
only achieved at the cost of a partial step backwards. These
regressions, in turn, are remedied at the next stage of development.

The law of the negation of the negation explains the repetition at a
higher level of certain features and properties of the lower level and
the apparent return of past features. There is a constant struggle
between form and content and between content and form, resulting in the
eventual shattering of the old form and the transformation of the
content.

This whole process can be best pictured as a spiral, where the movement
comes back to the position it started, but at a higher level. In other
words, historical progress is achieved through a series of
contradictions. Where the previous stage is negated, this does not
represent its total elimination. It does not wipe out completely the
stage that it supplants.

"The capitalist method of appropriation, which springs from the
capitalist method of production, and therefore capitalist private
property, is the first negation of individual private property based on
one's own labour. But capitalist production begets with the
inevitableness of a natural process its own negation. It is the negation
of the negation," remarked Marx in volume one of Capital.

Engels explains a whole series of examples to illustrate the negation of
the negation in his book Anti-Duhring. "Let us take a grain of barley.
Millions of such grains of barley are milled, boiled and brewed and then
consumed. But if such a grain of barley meets with conditions which for
it are normal, if it falls on suitable soil, then under the influence of
heat and moisture a specific change takes place, it germinates; the
grain as such ceases to exist, it is negated, and in its place appears
the plant which has arisen from it, the negation of the grain. But what
is the normal life-process of this plant? It grows, flowers, is
fertilised and finally once more produces grains of barley, and, as soon
as these have ripened, the stalk dies, is in its turn negated. As a
result of this negation of the negation we have once again the original
grain of barley, but not as a single unit, but ten, twenty or thirty
fold."

The barley lives and evolves by means of returning to its starting point
\- but at a higher level. One seed has produced many. Also over time,
plants have evolved qualitatively as well as quantitatively. Successive
generations have shown variations, and become more adapted to their
environment.

Engels gives a further example from the insect world. "Butterflies, for
example, spring from the egg through a negation of the egg, they pass
through certain transformations until they reach sexual maturity, they
pair and are in turn negated, dying as soon as the pairing process has
been completed and the female has laid its numerous eggs."

= Hegel and Marx

Hegel, who had a giant intellect, illuminated a great many things. It
was a debt that Marx repeatedly recognised. "The mystification which
dialectic suffers in Hegel's hands, by no means prevents him from being
the first to present its general form of working in a comprehensive and
conscious manner," states Marx. Nevertheless, Hegel's philosophical
system was a huge miscarriage. It suffered from an incurable internal
contradiction. Hegel's conception of history is an evolutionary one,
where there is nothing final or eternal. However, his system laid claim
to being the absolute truth, in complete contradiction to the laws of
dialectical thought. While Hegel defended the status quo in Germany, the
dialectic embraced a revolutionary view of constant change. For Hegel,
all that was real was rational. But using the Hegelian dialectic, all
that is real will become irrational. All that exists deserves to perish.
In this lay the revolutionary significance of the Hegelian philosophy.

The solution of this contradiction led back to materialism, but not the
old mechanical materialism, but one based upon the new sciences and
advances. "Materialism rose again enriched by all the acquisitions of
idealism. The most important of these acquisitions was the dialectical
method, the examination of phenomena in their development, in their
origin and destruction. The genius who represented this new direction of
thought was Karl Marx," writes Plekhanov. Spurred on by revolutionary
developments in Europe in 1830-31, the Hegelian School split into left,
right and centre.

The most prominent representative of the Hegelian Left was Ludwig
Feuerbach who challenged the old orthodoxy, especially religion, and
placed materialism at the centre of things again. "Nature has no
beginning and no end. Everything in it is in mutual interaction,
everything at once effect and cause, everything in it is all-sided and
reciprocal…" writes Feuerbach, adding that there is no place there for
God. "Christians tear out the spirit, the soul, of man out of his body
and make this torn-out, disembodied spirit into their God." Despite
Feuerbach's limitations, Marx and Engels welcomed the new breakthrough
with enthusiasm.

#quote(block: true)[
  "But in the meantime", noted Engels, "the Revolution of 1848 thrust the
  whole of philosophy aside as unceremoniously as Feuerbach himself was
  also pushed into the background." It was left to Marx and Engels to
  consistently apply the dialectic to the new materialism, producing
  dialectical materialism. For them, the new philosophy was not an
  abstract philosophy, but directly linked to practice.

  "Dialectics reduces itself to the science of the general laws of motion,
  both of the external world and of human thought - two sets of laws which
  are identical in substance, but differ in their expression in so far as
  the human mind can apply them consciously, while in nature and also up
  to now for the most part in human history, these laws assert themselves
  unconsciously, in the form of external necessity, in the midst of an
  endless series of seeming accidents." (Engels)
]

Neither Marx nor Engels left behind them a comprehensive book on
dialectics as such. Marx was preoccupied with Capital. Engels intended
to write such a book, but was overtaken by the need to complete Capital
after Marx's death. He nevertheless wrote quite extensively on the
subject, especially in Anti-Dühring and the Dialectics of Nature. Lenin
commentated, "If Marx did not leave behind him a 'Logic' (with a capital
letter), he did leave the logic of Capital, and this ought to be
utilised to the full. In Capital, Marx applied to a single science
logic, dialectics and the theory of knowledge of materialism (three
words are not needed: it is one and the same thing) which has taken
everything valuable in Hegel and developed it further."

Today, a small number of scientists, mainly from the natural sciences,
have become conscious of the dialectic, which has opened their eyes to
problems in their specialised fields. This relationship between science
and dialectical materialism has been fully discussed in the book by Alan
Woods and Ted Grant Reason in Revolt. They showed, along with Engels,
that nature is completely dialectical. Apart from Stephen J. Gould and
Niles Eldredge, Richard Levins and Richard Lewontin, who regard
themselves as dialectical materialists, have also written about the
application of the dialectic to the field of biology in their book The
Dialectical Biologist:

#quote(block: true)[
  “What characterises the dialectical world, in all its aspects, as we
  have described it is that it is constantly in motion. Constants become
  variables, causes become effects, and systems develop, destroying the
  conditions that gave rise to them. Even elements that appear to be
  stable are in a dynamic equilibrium of forces that can suddenly become
  unbalanced, as when a dull grey lump of metal of a critical size becomes
  a fireball brighter than a thousand suns. Yet the motion is not
  unconstrained and uniform. Organisms develop and differentiate, then die
  and disintegrate. Species arise but inevitably become extinct. Even in
  the simple physical world we know of no uniform motion. Even the earth
  rotating on its axis has slowed down in geological time. The development
  of systems through time, then, seems to be the consequence of opposing
  forces and opposing motions.

  "This appearance of opposing forces has given rise to the most debated
  and difficult, yet the most central, concept in dialectical thought, the
  principle of contradiction. For some, contradiction is an epistemic
  principle only. It describes how we come to understand the world by a
  history of antithetical theories that, in contradiction to each other
  and in contradiction to observed phenomena, lead to a new view of
  nature. Kuhn's (1962) theory of scientific revolution has some of this
  flavour of continual contradiction and resolution, giving way to new
  contradiction. For others, contradiction becomes an ontological property
  at least of human social existence. For us, contradiction is not only
  epistemic and political, but also ontological in the broadest sense.
  Contradictions between forces are everywhere in nature, not only in
  human social institutions. This tradition of dialectics goes back to
  Engels (1880) who wrote, in Dialectics of Nature, that 'to me there
  could be no question of building the laws of dialectics of nature, but
  of discovering them in it and evolving them from it.'" (The Dialectical
  Biologist, p.279)
]

Marxists have always stressed the unity of theory and practice.
"Philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the
point, however, is to change it", as Marx pointed to in his thesis on
Feuerbach. "If the truth is abstract it must be untrue," states Hegel.
All truth is concrete. We have to look at things as they exist, with a
view to understanding their underlying contradictory development. This
has very important conclusions, especially for those fighting to change
society. Unlike the Utopian socialists who viewed socialism as a
wonderful idea, Marxists see the development of socialism as arising out
of the contradictions of capitalism. Capitalist society has prepared the
material basis for a classless society with its highly developed
productive forces and its world division of labour. It has brought into
being the working class, whose very life existence brings it into
conflict with capitalism. On the basis of experience, it will become
fully conscious of its position in society and it will be transformed,
in the words of Marx, from a "class in-itself" to a "class for-itself".

Dialectics bases itself on determinism, but this has nothing in common
with fatalism which denies the existence of accident in nature, society
and thought. Dialectical determinism asserts the unity of necessity and
accident, and explains that necessity expresses itself through accident.
All events have causes, necessary events and accidental ones alike. If
there were no causal laws in nature everything would be in a state of
utter chaos. It would be an impossible position where nothing could
exist. So everything is dependent upon everything else, as in a
continuous chain of cause and effect. Particular events always have a
chance or accidental character, but these arise only as the result of a
deeper necessity. In fact, necessity manifests itself through a series
of accidents. Without doubt, accidents have their place, but the
essential thing is to discover what laws determine this deeper
necessity.

From the point of view of superficial observation, everything may appear
to be accidental or open to chance. This can appear especially so when
we have no knowledge of the laws that govern change and their
interconnections. "Where on the surface accident holds sway, there
actually it is always governed by inner, hidden laws and it is only a
matter of discovering these laws," remarked Engels in Ludwig Feuerbach.

In nature, the evolution of matter follows a certain path, although how,
when, and in what form this is realised, depends upon accidental
circumstances. For example, whether life was created or not on earth
depended on a whole series of accidental factors, such as the presence
of water, different chemical elements, the earth's distance from the
sun, an atmosphere, etc. "It is the nature of matter to advance to the
evolution of thinking beings", states Engels, "hence, too, this always
necessarily occurs whenever the conditions for it (not necessarily
identical at all places and times) are present…what is maintained to be
necessary is composed of sheer accidents, and the so-called accidental
is the form behind which necessity hides itself."

Superficial historians have written that the First World War was
"caused" by the assassination of a Crown Prince at Sarajevo. To a
Marxist this event was an historical accident, in the sense that this
chance event served as the pretext, or catalyst, for the world conflict
which had already been made inevitable by the economic, political and
military contradictions of imperialism. If the assassin had missed, or
if the Crown Prince had never been born, the war would still have taken
place, on some other diplomatic pretext or other. Necessity would have
expressed itself through a different "accident".

In the words of Hegel, everything which exists, exists of necessity.
But, equally, everything which exists is doomed to perish, to be
transformed into something else. Thus what is "necessary" in one time
and place becomes "unnecessary" in another. Everything begets its
opposite, which is destined to overcome and negate it. This is true of
individual living things as much as societies and nature generally.

Every type of human society exists because it is necessary at the given
time when it arises: "No social order ever disappears before all the
productive forces for which there is room in it, have been developed:
and new higher relations of production never appear before the material
conditions of their existence have matured in the womb of the old
society. Therefore mankind always takes up only such problems as it can
solve, since, looking at the matter more closely, we will always find
that the problem itself arises only when the material conditions
necessary for its solution already exist or at least are in the process
of formation." (Marx, Critique of Political Economy.)

Slavery, in its day, represented an enormous leap forward over
barbarism. It was a necessary stage in the development of productive
forces, culture and human society. As Hegel brilliantly explained it:
"It is not so much from slavery as through slavery that man becomes
free."

Similarly capitalism was originally a necessary and progressive stage in
human society. However, like primitive communism, slavery, and
feudalism, capitalism has long since ceased to represent a necessary and
progressive social system. It has foundered upon the deep contradictions
inherent in it, and is doomed to be overcome by the rising forces of the
new society within the old, represented by the modem proletariat.
Private ownership of the means of production and the nation state, the
basic features of capitalist society, which originally marked a great
step forward, now serve only to fetter and undermine the productive
forces and threaten all the gains made in centuries of human
development.

Capitalism is now a thoroughly degenerate social system, which must be
overthrown and replaced by its opposite, socialism, if human culture is
to survive. Marxism is determinist, but not fatalist. Men and women make
history. The transformation of society can only be achieved by men and
women consciously striving for their own emancipation. This struggle of
the classes is not pre-determined. Who succeeds depends on many factors,
and a rising, progressive class has many advantages over the old,
decrepit force of reaction. But ultimately, the result must depend upon
which side has the stronger will, the greater organisation and the most
skilful and resolute leadership.

The victory of socialism will mark a new and qualitatively different
stage of human history. To be more accurate it will mark the end of the
prehistory of the human race, and start a real history.

However on the other hand, socialism marks a return to the earliest form
of human society - tribal communism - but on a much higher level, which
stands upon all the enormous gains of thousands of years of class
society. The negation of primitive communism by class society is in turn
negated by socialism. The economy of superabundance will be made
possible by the application of conscious planning to the industry,
science and technique established by capitalism, on a world scale. This
in turn will once and for all make redundant the division of labour, the
difference between mental and manual labour, between town and
countryside, and the wasteful and barbaric class struggle and enable the
human race at last to set its resources to the conquest of nature: to
use Engels' famous phrase, "the leap of man from the realm of necessity
to the realm of freedom".
