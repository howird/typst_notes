= Preface

This work by Alan Woods, provides a comprehensive explanation of the
Marxist method of analysing history. This first part establishes the
scientific basis of historical materialism. The ultimate cause of all
social change is to be found, not in the human brain, but in changes in
the mode of production.

Marxists do not see history as a mere series of isolated facts but
rather, they seek to discover the general processes and laws that govern
nature and society. The first condition for science in general is that
we are able to look beyond the particular and arrive at the general. The
idea that human history is not governed by any laws is contrary to all
science.

= What is history?

Why should we accept that the entire universe, from the smallest
particles to the most distant galaxies, and the processes that determine
the evolution of all species, are governed by laws, and yet, for some
strange reason, our own history is not? The Marxist method analyses the
hidden mainsprings that underpin the development of human society from
the earliest tribal societies up to the modern day. The way in which
Marxism traces this winding road is called the materialist conception of
history.

Those who deny the existence of any laws governing human social
development invariably approach history from a subjective and moralistic
standpoint. But above and beyond the isolated facts, it is necessary to
discern broad tendencies, the transitions from one social system to
another, and to work out the fundamental motor forces that determine
these transitions.

Before Marx and Engels history was seen by most people as a series of
unconnected events or, to use a philosophical term, ‘accidents'. There
was no general explanation of this, beyond the unfolding of some divine
plan; history had no inner lawfulness.~

By establishing the fact that, at bottom, all human development depends
on the development of productive forces Marx and Engels for the first
time placed the study of history on a scientific basis.

This scientific method enables us to understand history, not as a series
of unconnected and unforeseen incidents, but rather as part of a clearly
understood and interrelated process. It is a series of actions and
reactions which cover politics, economics and the whole spectrum of
social development. To lay bare the complex dialectical relationship
between all these phenomena is the task of historical materialism.
Humankind constantly changes nature through labour, and in so doing,
changes itself.

= A caricature of Marxism

Science under capitalism tends to become less and less scientific, the
closer it gets to analysing society. The so-called social sciences
(sociology, economics, politics), and also bourgeois philosophy in
general, do not apply genuinely scientific methods at all, and therefore
end up as ill-concealed attempts to justify capitalism, or at least to
discredit Marxism (which boils down to the same thing).

Despite the ‘scientific' pretensions of bourgeois historians, the
writing of history inevitably reflects a class point of view. It is a
fact that the history of wars -- including the class war -- is written
by the winners. In other words, the selection and interpretation of
these events are shaped by the actual outcome of those conflicts as they
affect the historian, and in turn his perception of what the reader will
want to read. Moreover, in the last analysis, these perceptions will
always be influenced by the interests of a class or grouping in society.

When Marxists look at society they do not pretend to be neutral, but
openly espouse the cause of the exploited and oppressed classes.
However, that does not at all preclude scientific objectivity. A surgeon
involved in a delicate operation is also committed to saving the life of
his patient. He is far from neutral about the outcome. But for that very
reason, he will distinguish with extreme care between the different
layers of the organism. In the same way, Marxists will strive to obtain
the most scientifically exact analysis of social processes, in order to
be able to successfully influence the outcome.

Very often attempts are made to discredit Marxism by resorting to a
caricature of its method of historical analysis. There is nothing easier
than erecting a straw man in order to knock it down again. The usual
distortion is that Marx and Engels “reduced everything to economics.”
This mechanical caricature has nothing to do with Marxism. If that were
really the case, we would be absolved from the painful necessity of
fighting to change society. Capitalism would collapse and the new
society would fall into place of its own accord, as a ripe apple falls
into the lap of a man sleeping under a tree. But historical materialism
has nothing in common with fatalism.

This patent absurdity was answered in the following extract of Engels'
letter to Bloch:

#quote(block: true)[
  “According to the materialist conception of history, the ultimate
  determining element in history is the production and reproduction of
  life. More than this neither Marx and I have never asserted. Hence, if
  somebody twists this into saying that the economic element is the only
  determining one, he transforms that proposition into a meaningless,
  abstract and senseless phrase.” (Engels to Bloch, 21 September 1890,
  Selected Correspondence, p.~475)
]

In #emph[The Holy Family];, written before #emph[The Communist
  Manifesto];, Marx and Engels poured scorn on the idea of “History”
conceived apart from individual men and women, explaining that this was
merely an empty abstraction:

#quote(block: true)[
  “History does nothing, it ‘possesses no immense wealth', it ‘wages no
  battles'. It is man, real, living man who does all that, who possesses
  and fights; ‘history' is not, as it were, a person apart, using man as a
  means to achieve its own aims; history is nothing but the activity of
  man pursuing his aims.” (Marx and Engels, The Holy Family, Chapter VI)
]

All that Marxism does is to explain the role of the individual as part
of a given society, subject to certain objective laws and, ultimately,
as the representative of the interests of a particular class. Ideas have
no independent existence, nor their own historical development. "Life is
not determined by consciousness," Marx and Engels write in #emph[The
  German Ideology];, "but consciousness by life."

= Free will?

The ideas and actions of people are conditioned by social relations, the
development of which does not depend on the subjective will of men and
women, but which take place according to definite laws. These social
relations, in the last analysis, reflect the needs of development of the
productive forces. The interrelations between these factors constitute a
complex web that is often difficult to see. The study of these relations
is the basis of the Marxist theory of history.

But if men and women are not the puppets of “blind historical forces”,
neither are they entirely free agents, able to shape their destiny
irrespective of the existing conditions imposed by the level of economic
development, science and technique, which, in the last analysis,
determine whether a socio-economic system is viable or not. In #emph[The
  Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte];, Marx explains:

#quote(block: true)[
  "Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please;
  they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under
  circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past. The
  tradition of all dead generations weighs like an Alp on the brains of
  the living…"
]

Later Engels expressed the same idea in a different way:

#quote(block: true)[
  “Men make their own history, whatever its outcome may be, in that each
  person follows his own consciously desired end, and it is precisely the
  resultant of these many wills operating in different directions and of
  their manifold effects upon the outer world that constitutes history.” (
  Ludwig Feuerbach).
]

What Marxism does assert, and it is a proposition that surely nobody can
deny, is that in the last analysis, the viability of a given
socio-economic system will be determined by its ability to develop the
means of production, that is to say, the material foundations upon which
society, culture and civilisation are built.

The notion that the development of the productive forces is the basis
upon which all social development depends is really such a self-evident
truth that it is really surprising that some people still question it.
It does not require much intelligence to understand that before men and
women can develop art, science, religion or philosophy, they must first
have food to eat, clothes to wear and houses to live in. All these
things must be produced by someone, somehow. And it is equally obvious
that the viability of any given socio-economic system will ultimately be
determined by its ability to do this.

In his preface to #emph[A Contribution to the Critique of Political
  Economy] Marx explains the relation between the productive forces and
the “superstructure” as follows:

#quote(block: true)[
  “In the social production which men carry on they enter into definite
  relations that are indispensable and independent of their will; these
  relations of production correspond to a definite stage of development of
  their material powers of production… The mode of production in material
  life determines the general character of the social, political and
  spiritual processes of life. It is not the consciousness of men that
  determines their existence, but, on the contrary, their social existence
  (which) determines their consciousness.”
]

As Marx and Engels were at pains to point out, the participants in
history may not always be aware of what motives are driving them,
seeking instead to rationalise them in one way or another, but those
motives exist and have a basis in the real world.

From this we can see that the flow and direction of history has been---
and is---shaped by the struggles of successive social classes to mould
society in their own interests and the resulting conflicts between the
classes which flow from that. As the first words of #emph[The Communist
  Manifesto] remind us: “ The history of all hitherto existing societies
is the history of class struggle.” Historical materialism explains that
the motor force of social development is the class struggle.

= Marx and Darwin

Our species is the product of a very long period of evolution. Of
course, evolution is not a kind of grand design, the aim of which was to
create beings like ourselves. It is not a question of accepting some
kind of preordained plan, either related to Divine intervention or some
kind of teleology, but it is clear that the laws of evolution inherent
in nature do in fact determine the development from simple forms of life
to more complex forms.

The earliest forms of life already contain within them the embryo of all
future developments. It is possible to explain the development of eyes,
legs and other organs without recourse to any preordained plan. At a
certain stage we get the development of a central nervous system and a
brain. Finally, with Homo sapiens, we arrive at human consciousness.
Matter becomes conscious of itself. There has been no more important
revolution since the development of organic matter (life) from inorganic
matter.

Charles Darwin explained that the species are not immutable, and that
they possess a past, a present and a future, changing and evolving. In
the same way Marx and Engels explain that a given social system is not
something eternally fixed. Evolution shows how different life forms have
dominated the planet for very long periods but have been made extinct as
soon as the material conditions that determined their evolutionary
success changed. These previously dominant species have been replaced by
other species that were seemingly insignificant and even species that
seemed to have no prospect of survival.

Nowadays the idea of ‘evolution' has been generally accepted, at least
by educated persons. The ideas of Darwin, so revolutionary in his day,
are accepted almost as a truism. However, evolution is generally
understood as a slow and gradual process without interruptions or
violent upheavals. In politics, this kind of argument is frequently used
as a justification for reformism. Unfortunately, it is based on a
misunderstanding. The real mechanism of evolution even today remains a
book sealed by seven seals.

This is hardly surprising since Darwin himself did not understand it. It
was only as recently as the 1970s, with the new discoveries in
palaeontology made by Stephen J. Gould, who discovered the theory of
punctuated equilibria, that it was demonstrated that evolution is not a
gradual process. There are long periods in which no big changes are
observed, but at a given moment, the line of evolution is broken by an
explosion, a veritable biological revolution characterised by the mass
extinction of some species and the rapid ascent of others.

We see analogous processes in the rise and fall of different
socio-economic systems. The analogy between society and nature is, of
course, only approximate. But even the most superficial examination of
history shows that the gradualist interpretation is baseless. Society,
like nature, knows long periods of slow and gradual change, but also
here the line is interrupted by explosive developments---wars and
revolutions, in which the process of change is enormously accelerated.
In fact, it is these events that act as the main motor force of
historical development. And the root cause of revolution is the fact
that a particular socio-economic system has reached its limits and is
unable to develop the productive forces as before.

History has more than once furnished us with examples of apparently
powerful states that collapsed in a very short space of time. And it
also shows how political, religious and philosophical views that were
almost unanimously condemned became transformed into the accepted views
of the new revolutionary power that arose to take the place of the old.
The fact that the ideas of Marxism are the views of a small minority in
this society is therefore no cause for concern. Every great idea in
history has always started as a heresy and that applies as much to
Marxism today as it did to Christianity 2,000 years ago.

The ‘evolutionary adaptations' that originally enabled slavery to
replace barbarism, and feudalism to replace slavery in the end turned
into their opposite. And now the very features that enabled capitalism
to displace feudalism and emerge as the dominant socio-economic system
have become the causes of its decay. Capitalism is displaying all the
symptoms we associate with a socio-economic system in a state of
terminal decline. In many ways it resembles the period of the decline of
the Roman Empire as described in the writings of Edward Gibbon. In the
period that is now unfolding before us, the capitalist system is heading
for extinction.

= Socialism, utopian and scientific

By applying the method of dialectical materialism to history, it is
immediately obvious that human history has its own laws, and that,
consequently, it is possible to understand it as a process. The rise and
fall of different socio-economic formations can be explained
scientifically in terms of their ability or inability to develop the
means of production, and thereby to push forward the horizons of human
culture, and increase the domination of humankind over nature.

But what are the laws that govern historical change? Just as the
evolution of life has inherent laws that can be explained, and were
explained, first by Darwin and in more recent times by the rapid
advances in the study of genetics, so the evolution of human society has
its own inherent laws that were explained by Marx and Engels. In
#emph[The German Ideology];, which was written before #emph[The
  Communist Manifesto];, Marx writes:

#quote(block: true)[
  “The first premise of all human history is, of course, the existence of
  living human individuals. Thus the first fact to be established is the
  physical organisation of these individuals and their consequent relation
  to the rest of nature. (…) Men can be distinguished from animals by
  consciousness, by religion or anything else you like. They themselves
  begin to distinguish themselves from animals as soon as they begin to
  produce their means of subsistence, a step which is conditioned by their
  physical organisation. By producing their means of subsistence men are
  indirectly producing their actual material life.”
]

In #emph[Anti-Dühring];, written much later, Engels provides us with a
more developed expression of these ideas. Here we have a brilliant and
concise exposition of the basic principles of historical materialism:

#quote(block: true)[
  “The materialist conception of history starts from the proposition that
  the production of the means to support human life and, next to
  production, the exchange of things produced, is the basis of all social
  structure; that in every society that has appeared in history, the
  manner in which wealth is distributed and society divided into classes
  or orders is dependent upon what is produced, how it is produced, and
  how the products are exchanged. From this point of view, the final
  causes of all social changes and political revolutions are to be sought,
  not in men's brains, not in men's better insights into eternal truth and
  justice, but in changes in the modes of production and exchange.”
]

As opposed to the Utopian Socialist ideas of Robert Owen, Saint-Simon
and Fourier, Marxism is based upon a scientific vision of socialism.
Marxism explains that the key to the development of every society is the
development of the productive forces: labour, industry, agriculture,
technique and science. Each new social system -- slavery, feudalism and
capitalism -- has served to take human society forward through its
development of the productive forces.

The basic premise of historical materialism is that the ultimate source
of human development is the development of the productive forces. This
is a most important conclusion because this alone can permit us to
arrive at a scientific conception of history. Marxism maintains that the
development of human society over millions of years represents progress,
in the sense that it increases humankind's power over nature and thus
creates the material conditions for achieving genuine freedom for men
and women. However, this has never taken place in a straight line, as
the Victorians (who had a vulgar and undialectical view of evolution)
wrongly imagined. History has a descending line as well as an ascending
one.

Once one denies a materialist point of view, the only motor force of
historical events that one is left with is the role of individuals --
‘great men' (or women). In other words, we are left with an idealist and
subjectivist view of the historical process. This was the standpoint of
the Utopian Socialists, who, despite their brilliant insights and
penetrating criticism of the existing social order, failed to understand
the fundamental laws of historical development. For them, socialism was
just a ‘good idea', something that could therefore have been thought of
a thousand years ago, or tomorrow morning. Had it been invented a
thousand years ago, humankind would have been spared a lot of trouble!

It is impossible to understand history by basing oneself on the
subjective interpretations of its protagonists. Let us cite one example.
The early Christians, who expected the end of the world and the Second
Coming of Christ at every hour, did not believe in private property. In
their communities they practised a kind of communism (although their
communism was of the utopian kind, based on consumption, not
production). Their early experiments in communism led nowhere, and could
lead nowhere, because the development of the productive forces at that
time did not permit the development of real communism.

At the time of the English Revolution, Oliver Cromwell fervently
believed that he was fighting for the right of each individual to pray
to God according to his conscience. But the further march of history
proved that the Cromwellian Revolution was the decisive stage in the
irresistible ascent of the English bourgeoisie to power. The concrete
stage of development of the productive forces in 17th Century England
permitted no other outcome.

The leaders of the Great French Revolution of 1789-93 fought under the
banner of "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity". They believed they were
fighting for a regime based on the eternal laws of Justice and Reason.
However, regardless of their intentions and ideas, the Jacobins were
preparing the way for the rule of the bourgeoisie in France. Again, from
a scientific standpoint, no other result was possible at that point of
social development.

= Stages of historical development

The whole of human history consists precisely in the struggle of
humankind to raise itself above the animal level. This long struggle
began seven million years ago, when our remote hominin ancestors first
stood upright and were able to free their hands for manual labour. Ever
since then, successive phases of social development have arisen on the
basis of changes in the development of the productive force of labour --
that is to say, of our power over nature.

Human society has passed through a series of stages that are clearly
discernible. Each stage is based on a definite mode of production, which
in turn expresses itself in a definite system of social relations. These
further manifest themselves in a definite social outlook, psychology,
morality, laws and religion.

The relationship between the economic base of society and the
superstructure (ideology, morality, laws, art, religion, philosophy,
etc.) is not simple and direct but highly complex and even
contradictory. The invisible threads that connect the productive forces
and class relations are reflected in the minds of men and women in a
confused and distorted manner. And ideas that have their origin in the
primaeval past can linger on in the collective psyche for a very long
time, persisting stubbornly long after the real basis from which they
sprang has disappeared. Religion is a clear example of this. It is a
dialectical interrelation. This was clearly explained by Engels:

#quote(block: true)[
  “As to the realms of ideology which soar still higher in the air,
  religion, philosophy etc., these have a prehistoric stock, found already
  in existence and taken over in the historic period, of which we should
  today call bunk. These various false conceptions of nature, of man's own
  being, of spirits, magic forces, etc., have for the most part only a
  negative economic basis; but the low economic development of the
  prehistoric period is supplemented and also partially conditioned and
  even caused by the false conceptions of nature. And even though economic
  necessity was the main driving force of the progressive knowledge of
  nature and becomes ever more so, it would surely be pedantic to try and
  find economic causes for all this primitive nonsense.

  "The history of science is the history of the gradual clearing away of
  this nonsense or of its replacement by fresh but already less absurd
  nonsense. The people who deal with this belong in their turn to special
  spheres in the division of labour and appear to themselves to be working
  in an independent field. And insofar as they form an independent group
  within the social division of labour, in so far do their productions,
  including their errors, react back as an influence upon the whole
  development of society, even on economic development. But all the same
  they themselves remain under the dominating influence of economic
  development." (Marx and Engels, Selected Correspondence, pp.~482-3.)
]

And again:

#quote(block: true)[
  "But the philosophy of every epoch, since it is a definite sphere in the
  division of labour, has as its presupposition certain definite
  intellectual material handed down to it by its predecessors, from which
  it takes its start. That is why economically backward countries can
  still play first fiddle in philosophy." ( ibid., p.~483).
]

Ideology, tradition, morality, religion etc., all play a powerful role
in shaping people's beliefs. Marxism does not deny this self-evident
fact. Contrary to what the idealists believe, human consciousness in
general is very conservative. Most people do not like change, especially
sudden, violent change. They will cling to the things they know and have
got used to: the ideas, religions, institutions, morality, leaders and
parties of the past. Routine, habit and customs all lie like a leaden
weight on the shoulders of humanity. For all these reasons consciousness
lags behind events.

However, at certain periods great events force men and women to question
their old beliefs and assumptions. They are jolted out of the old
supine, apathetic indifference and forced to come to terms with reality.
In such periods consciousness can change very rapidly. That is what a
revolution is. And the line of social development, which can remain
fairly constant and unbroken for long periods, has been interrupted by
revolutions that are the necessary motor-force of human progress.

= Early human society

If we look at the entire process of human history and prehistory, the
first thing that strikes us is the extraordinary slowness with which our
species developed. The gradual evolution of human or humanoid creatures
away from the condition of animals and towards a genuinely human
condition took place over millions of years. The first decisive leap was
the separation of the first hominin species (meaning closely related to
modern humans) from their simian ancestors.

The evolutionary process is, of course, blind -- that is to say, it does
not involve an objective or specific goal. However, our hominin
ancestors, first by standing upright, then by using their hands to
manipulate tools and finally by producing them, found a niche in a
particular environment that impelled them forward.

Ten million years ago apes constituted the dominant species on the
planet. They existed in a great variety -- tree dwellers, ground
dwellers, and a host of intermediate forms. They flourished in the
prevailing climatological conditions that created a perfect tropical
environment. Then all this changed. About seven or eight million years
ago most of these species died out. The reason for this is not known.

For a long time the investigation of human origins was bedevilled by the
idealist prejudice that stubbornly maintained that, since the main
difference between humans and other apes is the brain, our earliest
ancestors must have been apes with a large brain. The “big brain” theory
utterly dominated early anthropology. They spent many decades searching
-- without success -- for the “missing link”, which they were convinced
would be a fossil skeleton with a large brain, combined with otherwise
simian characteristics.

So convinced were they that the scientific community were completely
taken in by one of the most extraordinary frauds in scientific history.
On the 18th of December 1912 fragments of a fossil skull and jawbone
were said to be that of the “missing link -- Piltdown Man'. This was
hailed as a great discovery. But in 1953 a team of English scientists
exposed Piltdown Man as a deliberate fraud. Instead of being almost a
million years old, the skull fragments were found to be 500 years old,
and the jaw in fact belonged to an orang-utan.

Why was the scientific community so easily fooled? Because they were
presented with something they expected to find: an early hominid skull
with a large brain. As a matter of fact, it was the upright stance
(bipedalism), and not the size of the brain, which freed the hands for
labour, that was the decisive turning point in human evolution.

This was already anticipated by Engels in his brilliant work on human
origins, #emph[The Part Played by Labour in the Transition of Ape to
  Man];. The celebrated American palaeontologist, Stephen Jay Gould, wrote
that it was a pity that scientists had not paid attention to what Engels
wrote, as this would have spared them a hundred years of error. The
discovery of Lucy, the fossilised skeleton of a young female who
belonged to a new species called Australopithecus Afarensis, showed that
Engels was right. The body structure of early hominins is like our own
(the pelvis, leg bones etc.) thus proving bipedalism. But the size of
the brain is not much bigger than a chimpanzee.

Our distant ancestors were small in size and slow-moving in comparison
with other animals. They did not have powerful claws and teeth.
Moreover, the human baby is completely helpless at birth.~ Dolphins are
born swimming, cattle and horses can walk within hours of being born and
lions are able to run within 20 days of birth.

Compare this to a human baby who will require months just to be able to
merely sit without support. More advanced skills like running and
jumping may take years to develop in a newborn human. As a species,
therefore, we were at a considerable disadvantage in comparison to our
numerous competitors on the savannah of East Africa. Manual labour,
together with co-operative social organisation and language, which are
connected with it, was the decisive element in human evolution. The
production of stone tools gave our early ancestors a vital evolutionary
advantage, triggering the development of the brain.

The first period, which Marx and Engels called savagery, was
characterised by an extremely low development of the means of
production, the production of stone tools, and a hunter-gatherer mode of
existence. Due to this the line of development remains virtually flat
for a very long period. The hunter-gathering mode of production
originally represented the universal condition of humankind. Those
surviving remnants that, until quite recently, could be observed in
certain parts of the globe provide us with important clues and insights
into a long-forgotten way of life.

It is not true, for example, that human beings are naturally selfish. If
this were the case, our species would have been extinct over two million
years ago. It was a powerful sense of cooperation that held these groups
together in the face of adversity. They cared for the small babies and
their mothers and respected the old members of the clan who preserved in
their memory its collective knowledge and beliefs. Our early ancestors
did not know what private property was, as Anthony Barnett points out:

#quote(block: true)[
  “The contrast between man and other species is equally clear if we
  compare the territorial behaviour of animals with property-holding by
  people. Territories are maintained by formal signals, common to a whole
  species. Every adult or group of each species holds a territory. Man
  displays no such uniformity: even within a single community, vast areas
  may be owned by one person, while others have none. There is, even
  today, ownership in people. But in some countries private ownership is
  confined to personal property. In a few tribal groups even minor
  possessions are held in common. Man has, in fact, no more a
  ‘property-owning instinct' than he has an ‘instinct to steal'. Granted,
  it is easy to rear children to be acquisitive; yet the form of the
  acquisitiveness, and the extent to which it is sanctioned by society,
  varies greatly from one country to the next, and from one historical
  period to another.” (Anthony Barnett, The Human Species, p.~142.)
]

Perhaps the word ‘savagery' is unfortunate nowadays because of the
negative connotations it has acquired. The 17th century English
philosopher Thomas Hobbes famously described the lives of our early
ancestors as one of “continual fear and danger of violent death, and the
life of man solitary, poor, nasty , brutish, and short.” No doubt their
life was a hard one, but these words hardly do justice to our ancestors'
way of life. The Kenyan anthropologist and archaeologist Richard Leakey
writes:

#quote(block: true)[
  "Hobbes's view that non-agricultural people have 'no society' and are
  'solitary' could hardly be more wrong. To be a hunter-gatherer is to
  experience a life that is intensely social. As for having 'no arts' and
  'no letters', it is true that foraging people possess very little in the
  form of material culture, but this is simply a consequence of the need
  for mobility. When the !Kung~ move from camp to camp they, like other
  hunter-gatherers, take all their worldly goods with them: this usually
  amounts to a total of 12 kilograms (26 pounds) in weight, just over half
  the normal baggage allowance on most airlines. This is an inescapable
  conflict between mobility and material culture, and so the !Kung carry
  their culture in their heads, not on their backs. Their songs, dances
  and stories form a culture as rich as that of any people." (Richard
  Leakey, The Making of Mankind, pp.~101-3)
]

He continues, “Richard Lee \[anthropologist and author of The !Kung San:
Men, Women, and Work in a Foraging Society, 1979\] considers that the
women do not feel themselves exploited: ‘They have economic prestige and
political power, a situation denied to many women in the 'civilised'
world'.” (Ibid. p.~103)

In these societies classes in the modern sense were unknown. There was
no state or organised religion and there was a deep sense of communal
responsibility and sharing. Egotism and selfishness were regarded as
deeply anti-social and morally offensive. The stress on equality demands
that certain rituals are observed when a successful hunter returns to
camp. The object of these rituals is to play down the event so as to
discourage arrogance and conceit: “The correct demeanour for the
successful hunter”, explains Richard Lee, “is modesty and
understatement.”

Again:

#quote(block: true)[
  “The !Kung~ have no chiefs and no leaders. Problems in their society are
  mostly solved long before they mature into anything that threatens
  social harmony. (…) People's conversations are common property, and
  disputes are readily defused through communal bantering. No one gives
  orders or takes them. Richard Lee once asked /Twi!gum whether the !Kung~
  have headmen. 'Of course we have headmen, he replied, much to Richard
  Lee's surprise. In fact, we are all headmen; each one of us is a headman
  over himself!' /Twi!gum considered the question and his witty answer to
  be a great joke.” (ibid. p.107)
]

The basic principle that guides every aspect of life is sharing. Among
the !Kung~ when an animal is killed, an elaborate process of sharing the
raw meat begins along lines of kinship, alliances and obligations.
Richard Lee emphasises the point strongly:

#quote(block: true)[
  “Sharing deeply pervades the behaviour and values of !Kung foragers,
  within the family and between families, and it is extended to the
  boundaries of the social universe. Just as the principle of profit and
  rationality is central to the capitalist ethic, so is sharing central to
  the conduct of social life in foraging societies.” (Ibid.)
]

Boastfulness was frowned upon and modesty encouraged, as the following
extract shows:

#quote(block: true)[
  “A !Kung~ man describes it this way: 'Say that a man has been hunting.
  He must not come home and announce like a braggart, 'I have killed a big
  one in the bush!' He must first sit down in silence until someone else
  comes up to his fire and asks, 'What did you see today?' He replies
  quietly, 'Ah, I'm no good for hunting. I saw nothing at all… Maybe just
  a tiny one.' Then I smile to myself because I now know he has killed
  something big. 'the bigger the kill, the more it is played down. (…) The
  jesting and understatement is strictly followed, again not just by the
  !Kung~ but by many foraging people, and the result is that although some
  men are undoubtedly more proficient hunters than others, no one accrues
  an unusual prestige or status because of his talents.” (Leakey,
  pp.~106-7.)
]

This ethic is not confined to the !Kung; it is a feature of
hunter-gatherers in general. Such behaviour, however, is not automatic;
like most of human behaviour, it has to be taught from childhood. Every
human infant is born with the capacity to share and the capacity to be
selfish, Richard Lee says. “That which is nurtured and developed is that
which each individual society regards as most valuable.” In that sense
the ethical values of these early societies are vastly superior to those
of capitalism, which teach people to be greedy, selfish and antisocial.

Of course, it is impossible to say with certainty that this is an exact
picture of early human society. But similar conditions tend to produce
similar results, and the same tendencies can be observed in many
different cultures on the same level of economic development. As Richard
Lee says:

#quote(block: true)[
  “We mustn't imagine that this is the exact way in which our ancestors
  lived. But I believe that what we see in the !Kung~ and other foraging
  people are patterns of behaviour that were crucial to early human
  development.' Of the several types of hominid that were living two to
  three million years ago, one of them -- the line that eventually led to
  us -- broadened its economic base by sharing food and including more
  meat in its diet. The development of a hunting and gathering economy was
  a potent force in what made us human.” (Quoted in Leakey,~ pp.~108-9.)
]

In comparing the values of hunter-gatherer societies with those of our
own times, we do not always get the better of it. For example, just
compare the contemporary family, with its ghastly record of wife and
child abuse, orphans and prostitutes, with the communal child-rearing
practiced by humanity during most of its history; that is, before the
advent of that strange social arrangement that men are fond of calling
civilisation:

#quote(block: true)[
  "'You white people,' an American Indian said to a missionary, 'love your
  own children only. We love the children of the clan. They belong to all
  the people, and we care for them. They are bone of our bone, and flesh
  of our flesh. We are all father and mother to them. White people are
  savages; they do not love their children. If children are orphaned,
  people have to be paid to look after them. We know nothing of such
  barbarous ideas.'" (M. F. Ashley Montagu, ed., Marriage: Past and
  Present: A Debate Between Robert Briffault and Bronislaw Malinowski,
  Boston: Porter Sargent Publisher, 1956, p.~48.)
]

However, we must not have an idealised view of the past. Life for our
early ancestors remained a hard struggle, a constant battle against the
forces of nature for survival. The pace of progress was extremely slow.
Early humans began making stone tools at least 2.6 million years ago.
The oldest stone tools, known as the Oldowan continued for about a
million years until about 1.76 million years ago, when early humans
began to strike really large flakes and then continue to shape them by
striking smaller flakes from around the edges, resulting in a new kind
of tool: the hand axe. These and other kinds of large cutting tools
characterise the Acheulean culture. These basic tools, including a
variety of new forms of stone core, continued to be made for an immense
period of time -- ending in different places by around 400,000 to
250,000 years ago.

= The Neolithic Revolution

For most of human history, this process has been painfully slow, as
#emph[The Economist] remarked on the eve of the new millennium:

#quote(block: true)[
  "For nearly all of human history, economic advance has been so slow as
  to be imperceptible within the span of a lifetime. For century after
  century, the annual rate of economic growth was, to one place of
  decimals, zero. When growth did happen it was so slow as to be invisible
  to contemporaries -- and even in retrospect it appears not as rising
  living standards (which is what growth means today), merely as a gentle
  rise in population. Down the millennia, progress, for all but a tiny
  elite, amounted to this: it slowly became possible for more people to
  live, at the meanest level of subsistence." (#emph[The Economist];,
  December 31, 1999)
]

Human progress begins to accelerate as a result of the first and most
important of these great revolutions, which was the transition from the
primitive hunter-gatherer mode of production to agriculture. This laid
the basis for a settled existence and the rise of the first towns. This
was the period Marxists refer to as barbarism, that is, the stage
between hunter-gatherer society (or ‘savagery') and early class society,
when classes begin to form and with them the state.

This decisive turning point, which the archaeologist V. Gordon Childe
called the Neolithic Revolution, represented a great leap forward in the
development of human productive capacity, and therefore of culture. This
is what Childe has to say: "Our debt to preliterate barbarism is heavy.
Every single cultivated food plant of any importance has been discovered
by some nameless barbarian society." (G. Childe, What Happened in
History, p.~64)

Agriculture began in the Middle East around 12,000 years ago. The new
conditions of production produced a new outlook on life, social
relations and the relations that bind men and women to the natural world
and the universe, whose secrets were probed in a way previously undreamt
of. The understanding of nature is made necessary by the demands of
agriculture, and advances slowly to the degree that men and women
actually learn to conquer and subdue the hostile forces of nature in
practice -- through collective labour on a grand scale.~

The most magnificent examples of this collective labour can be found in
the ‘megalithic' art of this period, such as Stonehenge, the
construction of which involved the transportation of gigantic ‘sarsen'
stones, weighing between 25 and 30 tons over a distance of 20 miles.
These, along with other, smaller ‘bluestones' from as far as West Wales,
were meticulously arranged in relation to the solstices. That this
impressive feat was achieved using Stone Age technology continues to
baffle and amaze archaeologists to this day. And this is only one of
many megalithic sites around the world.

The cultural and religious revolution reflected the great social
revolution -- the greatest in all human history till now -- that paved
the way for the dissolution of the primitive commune and established
private property of the means of production. And the means of production
are the means of life itself.

On the basis of the domestication of plants and animals, permanent
villages mushroomed across the region known as the Fertile Crescent. The
neolithic period also saw the growth of the first towns, such as Jericho
(modern Palestine), first dated to 9,500 BC, and Catalhoyuk (modern
Turkey), which had an estimated average population of 5,000-7,000 people
between 7,100 to 5,600 BC.

The new mode of production also spread to Europe and South Asia, and
arose independently at different times all over the world, including
China, Central America, the Andes and the Sahel.

The period of barbarism, which begins with the Neolithic, represents a
very large slice of human history, and is divided into several more or
less distinct periods. In general, it is characterised by the transition
from the hunter-gathering mode of production to pastoralism and
agriculture, that is, from Palaeolithic savagery, passing through to the
threshold of civilisation.

In this period the development of the productive forces gave rise to a
sustainable surplus for the first time in history, which allowed not
only for an expansion of population but a greater division of labour and
an increase in trade between settlements. Here is the embryo out of
which grew great cities, writing, industry and everything else that laid
the basis for what we call civilisation. However, this equally laid the
basis for the rise of inequality, social classes and the state.

At the most advanced stage of barbarism, the old communal way of life
begins to decay, and out of this decay new, class-based institutions
begin to arise. This process appears at different times in different
places - as early as the fourth millennium BC in Mesopotamia, the first
millennium BC in the case of Britain and even later in the case of the
Vikings.

In the Bronze Age, and the preceding Chalcolithic, or ‘Copper Age',
innovations such as irrigation and the ox-drawn cart greatly improved
the productivity of agriculture. This along with the development of
metalworking and new tools, such as the potter's wheel and the loom,
contributed to an increasingly sophisticated division of labour within
settlements, with groups of specialist craftspeople such as potters.

At this stage a privileged priest or warrior caste begins to raise
itself above the rest of society and appropriate the bulk of the surplus
for itself. In Mesopotamia and Egypt, for example, the priests and
temple bureaucrats were freed from menial work, and began to develop
mathematics and astronomy in order to better direct the production and
distribution of the surplus.~

The introduction of iron weapons and tools represented another
revolution in the development of the productive forces. In Iron Age
Europe, the growing surplus became an attractive target for raids,
leading to continuous warfare between neighbouring tribes. Settlements
were therefore often fortified with huge earthworks, such as Maiden
castle in Dorset and Danebury in Hampshire.

Alongside the fortified settlements that characterise the period, we
also find the emergence of powerful war-leaders, or chiefs, and a marked
difference in wealth across society. The surplus produced was not
reinvested, as there was no way this could be done. Part of the surplus
was appropriated by the chief and his family. Part of it was used up in
feasting, which occupied a central role in this society.

In a single feast as many as 200-300 people could be fed. In the remains
of one such feast the bones of 12 cows and a large number of sheep, pigs
and dogs were discovered. These gatherings were not only the occasion
for excesses of food and drink -- they played an important social and
religious role. In such ceremonies people gave thanks to the gods for
the surplus of food. They permitted the mingling of the clans and the
settling of communal affairs. Such lavish feasts also provided the
chiefs the means by which to display their wealth and power and thus
boost the prestige of the tribe or clan concerned.

Another result of warfare was a large number of prisoners of war, many
of whom were enslaved and either put to work by their captors or sold
like commodities. Sumerian records refer to the use of war captives as
slave labour on temple estates, while around 700 BC, Homer would write:~

#quote(block: true)[
  “Rather I'd choose laboriously to bear

  A weight of woes, and breathe the vital air,

  A slave to some poor hind that toils for bread,

  Than reign the sceptred monarch of the dead.”~
]

The growth of movable property and trade encouraged the rise of private
property, and with it the concentration of wealth and power into the
hands of a minority. This concentration of wealth can be seen in the
spectacular individual tombs of the period. The question of inheritance
thus began to assume a burning importance. This brought about a dramatic
change in the relations between men and women and their offspring.~

Upon this foundation would eventually rise the first states, “special
bodies of armed men” as Lenin called them, to defend property and keep
the struggle between the newly formed classes within the bounds of
order.~

Here we have the first great instance of alienation. Man's essence is
alienated from him in a double or triple sense. First, private property
signifies the alienation of his product, which is appropriated by
another. Second, his control over his life and destiny is appropriated
by the state in the person of the king or pharaoh. Last, but not least,
this alienation is carried over from this life to the next -- the inner
being (‘soul') of all men and women is appropriated by the deities of
the next world, whose good will must be continually obtained through
prayers and sacrifices. And just as the services to the monarch form the
basis of the wealth of the upper class of mandarins and nobles, so the
sacrifices to the gods form the basis of the wealth and power of the
priest caste that stands between the people and the gods and goddesses.
Here we have the genesis of organised religion.

The roots of civilisation are therefore to be found precisely in
barbarism, and still more so, in slavery. The development of barbarism
tends to end up in slavery or else in what Marx called the “Asiatic mode
of production”.

However, there have been societies that appear to have retained
egalitarian relations at the same time as highly productive agriculture,
sophisticated crafts and cities. The Indus Valley Civilisation, dated
from 3,300 to 1,300 BC, provides a remarkable example of this
phenomenon.~

The Indus people built large cities, notably Mohenjo Daro and Harappa
(both in modern Pakistan), which must have housed tens of thousands,
developed specialised and highly skilled craft industries, and traded
across long distances. But to this date archaeologists studying these
sites have found no real evidence of temple complexes, palaces, grand
monuments or elaborate tombs, like those of the Egyptian pharaohs. This
evidence powerfully suggests that the emergence of exploited and
exploiting classes and the state had not taken place, or was at most at
a very early stage of development.

Fascinating sites like Mohenjo Daro provide an insight into the wealth
of transitional and hybrid societies which must have appeared over the
thousands of years between the origin of agriculture and the first
states. But class societies would eventually come to dominate. The Indus
Valley Civilisation finally entered into decline from around 1,900 BC.
By 1,700 BC cities had completely disappeared from the region and would
eventually be replaced by the highly unequal society depicted in the
Hindu Rigveda.

The emergence of class society resulted in the subjection of the
majority by a minority. But on the broad scales of history, it was a
revolutionary phenomenon, in that it freed a privileged section of the
population -- a ruling class -- from the direct burden of labour,
permitting it the necessary time to develop art, science and culture.
Class society, despite its ruthless exploitation and inequality, was the
road that humankind needed to travel if it was to build up the necessary
material prerequisites for a future classless society.

= Asiatic mode of production

The really explosive growth of civilisation occurs with Egypt,
Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, China, Mexico and Peru. In other words,
the development of class society coincides with a massive upturn in the
productive forces, and as a result, of human culture, which reached
unprecedented heights. In Southern Mesopotamia the Sumerians built Ur,
Lagash, Eridu and other city-states. They were a literate people who
left behind thousands of clay tablets written in cuneiform script.

The main features of the Asiatic mode of production are:

+ An urban society with an agrarian base.

+ A primarily agricultural economy.

+ Public works which are frequently (but not always) identified with the
  need for irrigation and the upkeep and spread of intensive canal and
  drainage systems.

+ A despotic system of government, often with a god-king at the top.

+ A large bureaucracy.

+ A system of exploitation based on taxation.

+ Common (state) ownership of the land.

Although slavery existed (prisoners of war), these were not actually
slave societies. Labour service was not free, but those who performed it
were not slaves. There is an element of coercion, but the main thing is
habit, tradition and religion. The community serves the god-king (or
queen). It serves the temple (cf Israel). This is associated with the
state, and is the state.

The origins of the state are here mixed up with religion, and this
religious aura is maintained to the present. People are taught to look
up to the state with feelings of awe and reverence, as a force standing
above society, above ordinary men and women, who must serve it blindly.

The village commune, the basic cell of these societies, is almost
entirely self-sufficient. The few luxuries accessible to a population of
subsistence farmers are obtained from the bazaar or from travelling
peddlers who live on the margins of society. Money is scarcely known.
Taxes to the state are paid in kind. There is no connection between one
village and another and internal trade is weak. The real cohesion comes
from the state.

There was an almost total lack of social mobility, reinforced in some
cases by the caste system. The emphasis is on the group rather than the
individual. Endogamous marriage prevails -- that is, people tend to
marry strictly within their class or caste.~ Economically, they tend to
follow the professions of their parents. In the Hindu caste system this
is, in fact, obligatory. This lack of mobility and social rigidity helps
to tie the people to the land (the village commune).

As examples of this kind of society we have the Egyptians, Babylonians
and Assyrians, and the Shang or Yin dynasty (traditionally dating from
about 1,766 to 1,122 BC). In an entirely separate development, the
pre-Hispanic civilisations of Mexico and Peru, though with certain
variations, display strikingly similar features.

The tax system, and other methods of exploitation such as obligatory
labour service for the state (corvée) is oppressive but accepted as
inevitable and the natural order of things, sanctioned by tradition and
religion. Corvée is unfree labour, often unpaid, that is imposed on the
people, either by an aristocratic landowner, as in feudalism, or, as in
this case, by the state. But whereas the corvée system is similar to
that which is found in western feudalism, the system of land ownership
is not at all the same. In fact, the British rulers of India had the
greatest difficulty making sense of it.

Where towns and cities spring up it is usually along trade routes, on
the banks of rivers, in oases or other main sources of water. The towns
are the administrative and commercial centres for the villages. Here are
traders and artisans: ironworkers, carpenters, weavers, dyers,
shoemakers, masons, etc. Here also are the local representatives of the
state power, the only ones with which the mass of the population are
familiar: low grade civil servants, scribes and police or soldiers.

There are also moneylenders, charging usurious rates to the peasants who
are fleeced in turn by the tax-collector, the merchant and the village
usurer. Many of these ancient elements have survived until modern times
in some countries of the Middle East and Asia. But the advent of
colonialism destroyed the ancient Asiatic mode of production once and
for all. It was, in any case, an historical dead-end from which no
further development was possible.

In these societies the mental horizons of people are extremely limited.
The most powerful force in peoples' lives is the family or the clan,
which educates them and teaches them about their history, religion and
traditions. About politics and the world at large they know little or
nothing. Their only contact with the state is the village headman who is
responsible for collecting taxes.

What strikes one about these early civilisations is on the one hand
their longevity, on the other, the extremely slow development of the
productive forces and the extremely conservative nature of their
outlook. This was an essentially static model of society. The only
changes were the result of periodic invasions, e.g.~by the nomadic
barbarians of the steppes (the Mongols etc.), or occasional peasant
revolts (China) that led to a change of dynasty.

However, the substitution of one dynasty for another does not signify
any real change. The social relations and the state remain untouched by
all the changes at the top. The end result was always the same. The
invaders were absorbed and the system continued, undisturbed as before.

Empires rose and fell. There was a continuous process of fusion and
fission. But through all these political and military changes, nothing
fundamental changed for the peasantry at the bottom. Life continued its
seemingly eternal (and divinely ordained) routine. The Asiatic idea of a
never-ending cycle in religion is a reflection of this state of affairs.
At the bottom we had the ancient village commune, based on subsistence
agriculture that had survived virtually unchanged for millennia. Being
predominantly agricultural, the rhythm of their lives is dominated by
the eternal cycle of the seasons, the annual flooding of the Nile etc.

In recent years there has been a lot of noise in certain intellectual
and quasi-Marxist circles about the Asiatic mode of production. But
although Marx mentioned it, he did so only rarely and usually as an
aside. He never developed it, which he certainly would have done if he
had considered it important. The reason he did not do so was because it
was an historical dead end, comparable to the Neanderthals in human
evolution. It was a form of society, which, despite its achievements,
ultimately did not contain within itself the seeds of future
development. These were planted elsewhere: on the soil of Greece and
Rome.~~

= Slavery

Greek society was formed under different conditions to those of the
earlier civilisations. The small city-states of Greece lacked the vast
expanses of cultivable land, the great plains of the Nile or Indus
Valley and Mesopotamia. Hemmed in by barren mountain ranges, they faced
to the sea, and this fact determined their whole course of development.
Ill-suited both to agriculture or industry, they were pushed in the
direction of the sea, becoming a trading nation and an intermediary, as
the Phoenicians had done earlier.

Ancient Greece has a different socio-economic structure, and
consequently a different spirit and a different outlook to the earlier
societies of Egypt and Mesopotamia. Hegel says that in the East, the
ruling spirit was freedom for the One (i.e.~for the ruler, the
god-king). But in Greece it was freedom for the many, that is to say,
freedom for the citizens of Athens who did not happen to be slaves. But
the slaves who did most of the work had no rights at all. Neither did
women or foreigners.

For the free citizens, Athens was a most advanced democracy. This new
spirit, infused with humanity and individualism, affected Greek art,
religion and philosophy, which are qualitatively different to that of
Egypt and Mesopotamia. When Athens was mistress of all Greece, she had
neither a treasury nor a regular system of taxation. This was completely
different to the Asiatic system in Persia and other earlier
civilisations. But all this was based ultimately on the labour of the
slaves, who were private property.

The main division was between free men and slaves. The free citizens did
not usually pay taxes, which were regarded as degrading (as was manual
labour). However, there was also a bitter class struggle in Greek
society, characterised by a sharp division within the free population,
based on property. The slaves, as chattel that could be bought and sold,
were objects of production. The Roman word for a slave was
#emph[instrumentum vocale];, a tool with a voice. That puts it very
clearly, and despite all the changes of the last 2,000 years the real
position of the modern wage slave has not fundamentally changed since
then.

It may be objected, Greece and Rome stood on the basis of slavery, which
is an abhorrent and inhuman institution. But Marxists cannot look at
history from the point of view of morality. Apart from anything else,
there is no such thing as a supra-historical morality. Every society has
its own morality, religion, culture, etc. which correspond to a given
level of development, and, at least in the period we call civilisation,
also to the interests of a particular class.

Whether a particular war was good, bad or indifferent cannot be
ascertained from the point of view of the number of victims, and much
less from an abstract moral standpoint. We may strongly disapprove of
wars in general, but one thing cannot be denied: throughout the whole
course of human history, all serious questions have ultimately been
settled in this way. That goes both for the conflicts between nations
(wars) and also the conflicts between classes (revolutions).

Our attitude towards a particular type of society and its culture cannot
be determined by moralistic considerations. What determines whether a
given socio-economic formation is historically progressive or not is
first and foremost its ability to develop the productive forces -- the
real material basis upon which all human culture arises and develops.

Hegel, that wonderfully profound thinker, writes: "It was not so much
from slavery as through slavery that humanity was emancipated."
(Lectures on the Philosophy of History, p.~407). Despite its monstrously
oppressive character, slavery marked a step forward inasmuch as it
permitted a further development of the productive power of society. We
owe all the wonderful achievements of modern science to Greece and Rome
-- that is, to say, ultimately, to the labour of the slaves.

The Romans utilised brute force to subjugate other peoples, sold entire
cities into slavery, slaughtered thousands of prisoners of war for
amusement in the public circus, and introduced such refined methods of
execution as crucifixion. Yes, all that is perfectly true. To us it
seems a monstrous aberration. And yet, when we come to consider where
all our modern civilisation, our culture, our literature, our
architecture, our medicine, our science, our philosophy, even in many
cases our language, comes from, the answer is -- from Greece and Rome.

= Decline of slave society

Slavery contains an inner contradiction that led to its destruction.
Although the labour of the individual slave was not very productive
(slaves must be compelled to work), the aggregate of large numbers of
slaves, as in the mines and latifundia (large scale agricultural units)
in Rome in the last period of the Republic and the Empire, produced a
considerable surplus. At the height of the Empire, slaves were plentiful
and cheap and the wars of Rome were basically slave hunts on a massive
scale.

But at a certain stage this system reached its limits and then entered
into a lengthy period of decline. Since slave labour is only productive
when it is employed on a massive scale, the prior condition for its
success is an ample supply of slaves at a low cost. But slaves breed
very slowly in captivity and so the only way a sufficient supply of
slaves can be guaranteed is through continuous warfare. Once the Empire
had reached the limits of its expansion under Hadrian, this became
increasingly difficult.

The beginnings of a crisis in Rome can already be observed in the latter
period of the Republic, a period characterised by acute social and
political upheavals and class war. From the earliest beginnings there
was a violent struggle between rich and poor in Rome. There are detailed
accounts in the writings of Livy and others of the struggles between
Plebeians and Patricians, which ended in an uneasy compromise. At a
later period, when Rome had already made herself mistress of the
Mediterranean by the defeat of her most powerful rival Carthage, we saw
what was really a struggle for the division of the spoils.

Tiberius Gracchus demanded that the wealth of Rome be divided up among
its free citizens. His aim was to make Italy a republic of small farmers
and not slaves, but he was defeated by the nobles and slave-holders.
This was a disaster for Rome in the long run. The ruined peasantry --
the backbone of the Republic and its army -- drifted to Rome where they
constituted a lumpen-proletariat, a non-productive class, living off
dole from the state. Although resentful of the rich, they nevertheless
shared a common interest in the exploitation of the slaves -- the only
really productive class in the period of the Republic and the Empire.

The great slave rising under Spartacus was a glorious episode in the
history of antiquity. The spectacle of these most downtrodden people
rising up with arms in hand and inflicting defeat after defeat on the
armies of the world's greatest power is one of the most incredible
events in history. Had they succeeded in overthrowing the Roman state,
the course of history would have been significantly altered.

The basic reason why Spartacus failed in the end was the fact that the
slaves did not link up with the proletariat in the towns. So long as the
latter continued to support the state, the victory of the slaves was
impossible. However, the Roman proletariat, unlike the modern
proletariat, was not a productive class but purely a parasitical one,
living off the labour of the slaves and dependent on their masters. The
failure of the Roman revolution is rooted in this fact.

The defeat of the slaves led straight to the ruin of the Roman state. In
the absence of a free peasantry, the state was obliged to rely on a
mercenary army to fight its wars. The deadlock in the class struggle
produced a situation similar to the more modern phenomenon of
Bonapartism. The Roman equivalent is what we call Caesarism.

The Roman legionnaire was no longer loyal to the Republic but to his
commander -- the man who guaranteed his pay, his loot and a plot of land
when he retired. The last period of the Republic is characterised by an
intensification of the struggle between the classes, in which neither
side is able to win a decisive victory. As a result, the state (which
Lenin described as "armed bodies of men") began to acquire increasing
independence, to raise itself above society and to appear as the final
arbiter in the continuing power struggles in Rome.

A whole series of military adventurers appear: Marius, Crassus, Pompey,
and lastly Julius Caesar, a general of brilliance, a clever politician
and a shrewd businessman, who in effect put an end to the Republic
whilst paying lip-service to it. His prestige boosted by his military
triumphs in Gaul, Spain and Britain, he began to concentrate all power
in his hands. Although he was assassinated by a conservative faction who
wished to preserve the Republic, the old regime was doomed.

After Brutus and the others were defeated by the second triumvirate, the
Republic was formally recognised, and this pretence was kept up by the
first Emperor, Augustus. The very title ‘Emperor' (#emph[imperator] in
Latin) is a military title, invented to avoid the title of king that was
so offensive to republican ears. But a king he was, in all but name.

The forms of the old Republic survived for a long time after that. But
they were just that -- hollow forms with no real content, an empty husk
that in the end could be blown away by the wind. The Senate was devoid
of all real power and authority. Julius Caesar had shocked respectable
public opinion by making a Gaul a member of the senate. Caligula
considerably improved upon this by making his horse a senator. Nobody
saw anything wrong with this, or if they did they kept their mouths
firmly shut.

It often happens in history that outworn institutions can survive long
after their reason to exist has disappeared. They drag out a miserable
existence like a decrepit old man who clings onto life, until they are
swept away by a revolution. The decline of the Roman Empire lasted for
centuries. This was not an uninterrupted process. There were periods of
recovery and even brilliance, but the general line was downwards.

In periods like this, there is a general sense of malaise. The
predominant mood is one of scepticism, lack of faith and pessimism in
the future. The old traditions, morality and religion -- things that act
as a powerful cement holding society together -- lose their credibility.
In place of the old religion, people seek out new gods. In its period of
decline, Rome was inundated with a plague of religious sects from the
east. Christianity was only one of these, and although ultimately
successful, had to contend with numerous rivals, such as the cult of
Mithras.

When people feel that the world in which they live is tottering, that
they have lost all control over their existence and that their lives and
destinies are determined by unseen forces, then mystical and irrational
tendencies get the upper hand. People believe that the end of the world
is nigh. The early Christians believed this fervently, but many others
suspected it. In point of fact what was coming to an end was not the
world but only a particular form of society -- slave society. The
success of Christianity was rooted in the fact that it connected with
this general mood. The world was evil and sinful. It was necessary to
turn one's back on the world and all its works and look forward to
another life after death.

= Why the barbarians triumphed

By the time the barbarians invaded, the whole structure of the Roman
Empire was on the verge of collapse, not only economically, but morally
and spiritually. No wonder the barbarians were welcomed as liberators by
the slaves and poorer sections of society. They merely completed a job
that had been well prepared in advance. The barbarian attacks were a
historical accident that served to express a historical necessity.

The decay of the slave economy, the monstrously oppressive nature of the
Empire with its bloated bureaucracy and predatory tax farmers, was
already undermining the whole system. There was a steady drift to the
countryside where the basis was already being laid for the development
of a different mode of production -- feudalism. The barbarians merely
delivered the coup de grâce to a rotten and moribund system.~

In #emph[The Communist Manifesto] Marx and Engels wrote: “Freeman and
slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and
journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant
opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now
open fight, a fight that each time ended, #emph[either in a
  revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin
  of the contending classes];.” (My emphasis, AW)

What happened to the Roman Empire is a striking illustration of the
last-named variant. The failure of the oppressed classes of Roman
society to unite to overthrow the brutally exploitative slave-state led
to an inner exhaustion and a long and painful period of social, economic
and cultural decay, which prepared the way for the barbarians.

Once the Empire reached its limits and the contradictions inherent in
slavery began to assert themselves, Rome entered into a long period of
decline that lasted for centuries, until it was eventually overrun by
the barbarians, beginning with the Goths.~

First Greece, then Italy, were plundered and ravaged. Finally, for the
first time in six centuries, on 24 August 410 AD Rome was sacked by the
Visigoths led by their king, Alaric. This was only the beginning.~

After the Visigoths, and Ostrogoths came the Vandals, Alans, Lombards,
Suevi, Alemanni, Burgundians, Franks, Thuringians, Frisians, Heruli,
Gepidae, Angles, Saxons, Jutes, Huns and Magyars. They crashed their way
across the frontiers in successive waves. When the Vandals conquered the
African provinces in the 5th century AD, Rome's food supply was suddenly
interrupted, dealing a mortal blow to the Western Empire.~

The immediate effect of the barbarian onslaught was to wipe out
civilisation and throw society and human thought back for a thousand
years. The productive forces suffered a violent interruption. The cities
were destroyed or abandoned. The invaders were an agricultural people
and knew nothing of towns and cities. The barbarians in general were
hostile to the towns and their inhabitants (a psychology that is quite
common among peasants in all periods). This process of devastation, rape
and pillage was to continue for centuries, leaving behind a terrible
heritage of backwardness, which we call the Dark Ages.

Yet although the barbarians succeeded in conquering the Romans, they
themselves were fairly quickly absorbed, and even lost their own
language and ended up speaking a dialect of Latin. Thus, the Franks, who
gave their name to modern France, were a Germanic tribe speaking a
language related to modern German. The same thing happened to the
Germanic tribes that invaded Spain and Italy. This is what normally
happens when a more economically and culturally backward people conquers
a more advanced nation.~

Exactly the same thing happened later to the Mongol hordes that
conquered India. They were absorbed by the more advanced Hindu culture
and ended up founding a new Indian dynasty -- the Moguls.

= Feudalism

The rise of the feudal system following the collapse of Rome was
accompanied by a long period of cultural stagnation in all of Europe
north of the Pyrenees. With the exception of two inventions: the water
wheel and windmills, there were no real inventions for about over a
thousand years. One thousand years after the fall of Rome the only
decent roads in Europe were Roman roads. In other words, there was a
complete eclipse of culture. This was a result of the collapse of the
productive forces, upon which culture ultimately depends. That is what
we mean by a descending line in history. And let nobody imagine that
such a thing cannot recur.

The barbarian invasions, wars and plagues meant that progress was
punctuated with periods of retrogression. But eventually the chaotic
conditions that coincided with the fall of Rome were replaced by a new
equilibrium: feudalism. The decline of the Roman Empire caused a sharp
falling off of urban life throughout most of Europe. The barbarian
invaders were gradually absorbed and by the tenth century Europe entered
slowly into a new period of ascent.

Of course, this statement is relative in character. Culture did not
regain comparable levels to those of antiquity until the beginning of
the renaissance in the late 14th and 15th centuries. Learning and
science were strictly subordinated to the authority of the Church. Men's
energies were absorbed either in constant warfare or monastic dreams,
but gradually the downward spiral came to an end and was replaced by a
long upward slope.

The closing of avenues of communication led to a collapse of trade. The
money economy was undermined and increasingly replaced by barter. In
place of the integrated international economy of the slave system under
the Empire, we had the proliferation of small isolated agricultural
communities.

The basis of feudalism was already laid in Roman society, when the
slaves were freed and turned into colons, tied to the land, who later
became serfs. This process, which occurred at different times, assuming
different forms in different countries, was accelerated by the barbarian
conquests. The Germanic warlords became the lords of the conquered lands
and their inhabitants, offering military protection and a degree of
security in exchange for the exploitation of the labour of the serfs.

In the early period of feudalism the atomization of the nobility allowed
relatively strong monarchies but later the royal power found itself
confronted with strong estates capable of challenging it and
overthrowing it. The barons had their own feudal armies which they
frequently led into the field against each other and also against the
king.

The feudal system in Europe was mainly a decentralised system. The power
of the monarchy was limited by the aristocracy. The central power was
usually weak. The centre of gravity of the feudal lord, his power base,
was his manor and estate. The state power was weak and the bureaucracy
non-existent. This weakness of the centre was what later permitted the
independence of the towns (royal charters) and the emergence of the
bourgeoisie as a separate class.

The romantic idealisation of the Middle Ages is based on a myth. This
was a bloody and convulsive period, characterised by great cruelty and
barbarism and what Marx and Engels called a brutal display of energy.
The Crusades were characterised by unusual viciousness and inhumanity.
The German invasions of Italy were exercises in futility.

The last period of the Middle Ages was a troubled time, characterised by
continuous convulsions, wars and civil wars -- just like our own times.
To all intents and purposes the old order was already dead. Although it
still remained defiantly on its feet, its existence was no longer
regarded as something normal -- something that had to be accepted as
inevitable.

For more than a hundred years England and France were engaged in a
bloody war that reduced large parts of France to ruin. The battle of
Agincourt was the last and bloodiest battle of the Middle Ages. Here, in
essence, two rival systems were pitted against each other on the
battlefield: the old feudal military order, based on the nobility and
the idea of chivalry and service, clashed with a new mercenary army
based on wage labour.

The French nobility was decimated, defeated shamefully by an army of
mercenary commoners. In the first 90 minutes 8,000 of the flower of the
French aristocracy was butchered and 1,200 taken prisoner. At the end of
the day not only the whole of the French nobility lay dead and bleeding
on the battlefield, but the feudal order itself.

This had important social and political consequences. From this moment,
the French nobility's grip on power began to weaken. When the English
were driven from France it was by an uprising of the people led by a
peasant girl, Joan of Arc. Amidst the wreckage of their lives, the chaos
and bloodshed, the French people became conscious of their national
identity and acted accordingly. The bourgeois began to demand their
rights and charters and a new central monarchical power, leaning on the
bourgeoisie and the people, began to seize the reins of power, forging a
national state out of which modern France finally emerged.

= The Black Death

When a given socio-economic system enters into crisis and decline, this
is reflected not only in stagnation of the productive forces, but at
every level. The decline of feudalism was an epoch when intellectual
life was dead or dying. The dead hand of the Church paralysed all
cultural and scientific initiatives.

The feudal structure was based on a pyramid in which God and the King
stood at the top of a complex hierarchy, each segment of which was
linked to the others by so-called duties. In theory, the feudal lords
“protected” the peasants, who in return put food on their table and
clothes on their backs, fed and enabled them to live a life of luxury
and idleness; the priests prayed for their soul, the knights defended
them and so on.

This system lasted a very long time. In Europe it lasted approximately
one thousand years: from about the middle of the fifth to the middle of
the fifteenth centuries. But by the 13th century feudalism in England
and other countries was already reaching its limits. The growth in
population put the whole system under colossal strain. Marginal lands
had to be brought under cultivation, and much of the population merely
eked out a bare living at the level of subsistence on small plots of
land.

It was an “edge-of-chaos” situation, where the whole unsound edifice
could be brought crashing down by a sufficiently powerful external
shock. And what shock could be more powerful than this? The ravages of
the Black Death, which killed off between one third and half the
population of Europe, served to throw into sharp relief the injustice
and misery, ignorance and intellectual and spiritual darkness of the
fourteenth century.

It is now generally accepted that the Black Death played an important
role in undermining feudalism. This was particularly clear in the case
of England. Having already killed half the population of Europe, the
plague spread to England in the summer of 1348. As the plague spread
inland to the villages of rural England, the population was decimated.
Whole families, sometimes, whole villages, were wiped out. As on the
European mainland, about half the population perished. However, those
who managed to survive frequently found themselves in possession of
quite large amounts of land. A new class of rich peasants was being
created.

The colossal loss of life led to an extreme shortage of labour. There
were simply not enough labourers to gather in the harvest or artisans to
perform all the other necessary functions. This laid the basis for a
profound social transformation. Feeling their strength, the peasants
demanded, and got, higher wages and lower rents. If the lord refused to
meet their demands, they could always leave and go to another master who
was willing to do so. Some villages were abandoned altogether.

The old bonds were first loosened and then broken. As the peasants threw
off the yoke of feudal obligations, many flocked to the towns to seek
their fortune. This, in turn, led to a further development of the towns
and therefore furthered the rise of the bourgeoisie. In 1349 King Edward
III passed what was possibly the first wages policy in history: the
Ordinance of Labourers. This decreed that wages must be held at the old
levels. But the law was a dead letter from the start. The laws of supply
and demand were already stronger than any royal decree.

Everywhere there was a new spirit of rebelliousness. The old authority
was already undermined and discredited. The whole rotten edifice was
tottering for a fall. One good push, it seemed, would finish it. In
France there were a whole series of peasant uprisings known as
jacqueries. Even more serious was the Peasants Rising in England (1381),
when the rebels occupied London and for a time had the king in their
power. But ultimately these risings could not succeed.

These uprisings were just premature anticipations of the bourgeois
revolution at a time when the conditions for this had not completely
matured. They expressed the dead end of feudalism and the deep
discontent of the masses. But they could not show a way out. As a result
the feudal system, although substantially modified, survived for a
period, manifesting all the symptoms of a diseased and declining social
order. The last period of the Middle Ages was a troubled time,
characterised by continuous convulsions, wars and civil wars -- just
like our own times.

The feeling that the end of the world is nigh is common to every
historical period when a particular socio-economic system had entered
into irreversible decline. This was the period when large numbers of men
took to the roads, barefoot and dressed in penitential rags, flogging
themselves till they bled. The flagellant sects awaited the end of the
world, which they anxiously expected from one hour to the next.

In the end, what occurred was not the end of the world but only the end
of feudalism, and what arrived was not the new Millennium but only the
capitalist system. But they could not be expected to understand this.
One thing was clear to all. The old world was in a state of rapid and
irremediable decay. Men and women were torn by contradictory tendencies.
Their beliefs were shattered and they were cut adrift in a cold,
inhuman, hostile and incomprehensible world.

= The rise of the bourgeoisie

When all the old certainties were overthrown. It was as if the lynchpin
of the world had been removed. The result was terrifying turbulence and
uncertainty. By the middle of the 15th century, the old system of
beliefs began to unravel. People no longer looked to the Church to
provide salvation, comfort and solace. Instead religious dissention
arose in many different forms, and served as a guise for social and
political opposition.

Peasants were defying the old laws and restrictions, demanding freedom
of movement and asserting it by migrating to the towns without a
licence. Contemporary chronicles express the irritation of the lords at
the unwillingness of the labourers to take orders. There were even some
strikes.

Amidst all this darkness new forces were stirring, announcing the birth
of a new power and a new civilisation that was gradually growing up
inside the womb of the old society. The rise of trade and the towns
brought with it a new aspiring class, the bourgeoisie, which began to
jostle for position and power with the feudal ruling classes, the
nobility and the Church. The birth of a new society was announced in art
and literature, where new trends began to emerge in the course of the
next hundred years.

The rise of the towns, those islands of capitalism in a sea of
feudalism, was gradually undermining the old order. The new money
economy, appearing at the margins of society, was gnawing at the
foundations of feudal economy. The old feudal restrictions were now
unbearable impositions, intolerable barriers to progress. They had to be
shattered, and they were shattered. But the victory of the bourgeoisie
did not come all at once. A long period was required for it to gain a
final victory over the old order. Only gradually did a new spark of life
reappear in the towns.

The slow recovery of trade led to the rise of the bourgeoisie and a
revival of the towns, notably in Flanders, Holland and northern Italy.
New ideas began to appear. After the Fourth Crusade and the Sack of
Constantinople in 1204, there was a new interest in the ideas and art of
classical antiquity. New forms of art appeared in Italy and the
Netherlands. Boccaccio's #emph[Decameron] may be considered as the first
modern novel. In England the writings of Chaucer are full of life and
colour, reflecting a new spirit in art. The Renaissance was taking its
first hesitant steps. Gradually, out of chaos a new order was arising.

= The Reformation

By the 15th century the bourgeoisie was well established in Europe. The
Netherlands became the factory of Europe, and trade flourished along the
river Rhine. The cities of Northern Italy were a powerful locomotive of
economic growth and commerce, opening up trade with the East. From about
the 5th to the 12th centuries, Europe consisted of largely isolated
economies. No longer! The discovery of America, the rounding of the Cape
and the general expansion of trade gave a fresh impetus not only to the
creation of wealth but to the development of men's minds.

Under such conditions, the old intellectual stagnation was no longer
possible. The ground was cut from under the feet of the conservatives
and reactionaries, as Marx and Engels explained in #emph[The Communist
  Manifesto];:

#quote(block: true)[
  “The discovery of America, the rounding of the Cape, opened up fresh
  ground for the rising bourgeoisie. The East-Indian and Chinese markets,
  the colonisation of America, trade with the colonies, the increase in
  the means of exchange and in commodities generally, gave to commerce, to
  navigation, to industry, an impulse never before known, and thereby, to
  the revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society, a rapid
  development.”
]

It is no coincidence that the rise of the bourgeoisie in Italy, Holland,
England and later in France was accompanied by an extraordinary
flourishing of culture, art and science. Revolutions, as Marx once said,
“are the locomotives of history”. In countries where the bourgeois
revolution triumphed in the 17th and 18th centuries, the development of
the productive forces and technology was complemented by a parallel
development of science and philosophy, which undermined the ideological
dominion of the Church forever.

In the epoch of the rise of the bourgeoisie, when capitalism still
represented a progressive force in history, the first ideologists of
that class had to fight a hard battle against the ideological bastions
of feudalism, starting with the Catholic Church. Long before destroying
the power of feudal landlords, the bourgeoisie had to break down the
philosophical and religious defences mounted to protect the feudal
system around the Church and its militant arm, the Inquisition. This
revolution was anticipated by the revolt of Martin Luther against the
authority of the Church.

During the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries Germany saw a move from an
entirely agrarian economy and the rise of new social classes that
clashed with the traditional feudal hierarchy. Luther's attacks on the
Roman Catholic Church acted as the spark that ignited revolution. The
burghers and lesser nobility sought to break the power of the clergy,
escape the clutches of Rome, and, last but not least, enrich themselves
through the confiscation of church property.

But in the depths of feudal society, other more elemental forces were
stirring. When Luther's appeals against the clergy and ideas about
Christian freedom reached the ears of the German peasants, they acted as
a powerful stimulus to the repressed rage of the masses who had long
suffered in silence the oppression of the feudal lords. Now they rose up
to extract a terrible vengeance upon all their oppressors.

Beginning in 1524, the Peasants' War spread across the Germanic regions
of the Holy Roman Empire during 1525 until its suppression in 1526. What
happened after this has been repeated frequently in subsequent history.
When confronted with the consequences of his revolutionary ideas, Luther
had to choose a side, and he joined with the burghers, nobility, and
princes in crushing the peasants.

The peasants found a better leader in the person of Thomas Müntzer.
While Luther preached peaceful resistance, Thomas Müntzer attacked the
priesthood in violent sermons, calling for the people to rise up in
arms. Like Luther he cited biblical references to justify his actions:
“Does not Christ say, ‘I came not to send peace, but a sword'?”

The most radical wing of the movement were the Anabaptists, who were
already beginning to question private property, taking as their model
the primitive communism of the early Christians described in The Acts of
the Apostles. Müntzer maintained that the Bible was not infallible, that
the Holy Spirit had ways of communicating directly through the gift of
reason.

Luther was horrified and wrote the notorious pamphlet, #emph[Against the
  Murderous, Thieving Hoards of Peasants];. The revolt was crushed with
unspeakable barbarity, which set Germany back for centuries. But the
tide of bourgeois revolt that was reflected in the rise of Protestantism
was now unstoppable.

Those lands where the reactionary feudal forces quelled the embryo of
the new society before birth, were sentenced to the nightmare of a long
and inglorious period of degeneration, decline and decay. The example of
Spain is the most graphic in this regard.

= The bourgeois revolution

The first bourgeois revolution took the form of a national revolt of the
Netherlands against the oppressive rule of Catholic Spain. In order to
succeed, the wealthy Dutch burgers leaned on the men of no property:
those courageous desperados drawn mainly from the poorest layers of
society. The shock troops of the Dutch Revolution were known
contemptuously by their enemies as the Sea Beggars.

This description was not altogether inaccurate. They were poor artisans,
labourers, fishermen, homeless and dispossessed people -- all those
regarded as the dregs of society, but fired up with Calvinist
fanaticism, they inflicted one defeat after another on the forces of
mighty Spain. It was this that laid the basis for the rise of the Dutch
Republic and a modern prosperous bourgeois Holland.

The next episode in the bourgeois revolution was even more significant
and far-reaching in its implications. The English revolution of the
seventeenth century assumed the form of civil war. It expressed itself
as dual power, the royal power, resting upon the privileged classes or
the upper circles of these classes -- the aristocrats and bishops, based
in Oxford~ -- was confronted by the bourgeoisie and the small landowners
and plebeian masses, based around London.

The English Revolution only succeeded when Oliver Cromwell, basing
himself on the most radical elements, that is, the armed plebeians,
swept the bourgeoisie to one side and waged a revolutionary war against
the Royalists. As a result, the king was captured and executed. The
conflict ended with a purging of the Parliament and the dictatorship of
Cromwell.

The lower ranks of the army, under the leadership of the Levellers --
the extreme left wing of the revolution -- tried to carry the Revolution
further, questioning private property, but were crushed by Cromwell. The
reason for this defeat must be found in the objective conditions of the
period. Industry had not yet developed to the point where it could
provide the basis for socialism.

The proletariat itself remained at an embryonic stage of development.
The Levellers themselves represented the lower levels of the petty
bourgeoisie, and therefore, despite all their heroism, were unable to
have their own, individual historic path. After Cromwell's death the
bourgeoisie reached a compromise with Charles II that enabled it to hold
real power while maintaining the Monarchy as a bulwark against any
future revolutions against private property. This compromise would last
until Charles' heir, James II, was replaced by a more compliant dynasty
in a coup, the so-called Glorious Revolution of 1688, led by the Dutch
adventurer, William of Orange.~

The American Revolution, which took the form of a war of national
independence only succeeded to the degree that it involved the mass of
poor farmers who waged a successful guerrilla war against the armies of
King George III of England.

The French Revolution of 1789-93 was on a far higher level than the
English Revolution. This was one of the greatest events in human
history. Even today it is an endless source of inspiration. And whereas
Cromwell fought under the banner of religion, the French bourgeoisie
raised the banner of Reason. Even before it brought down the formidable
walls of the Bastille, it had brought down the invisible, but no less
formidable, walls of the Church and religion.

At every stage the motor force that drove the French Revolution forward,
sweeping aside all obstacles, was the active participation of the
masses. And when this active participation of the masses ebbed, the
Revolution came to a full stop and went into reverse. That was what led
directly to reaction, firstly of the Thermidorian and later of the
Bonapartist variety.

The enemies of the French Revolution always try to blacken its image
with the accusation of violence and bloodshed. As a matter of fact the
violence of the masses is inevitably a reaction against the violence of
the old ruling class. The origins of the Terror must be sought in the
reaction of the revolution to the threat of violent overthrow from both
internal and external enemies. The revolutionary dictatorship was the
result of revolutionary war and was only an expression of the latter.

Under the rule of Robespierre and the Jacobins, the semi-proletarian
Sans-culottes carried the Revolution to a successful conclusion. In
fact, the masses pushed the leaders to go far further than they had
intended. Objectively, the Revolution was bourgeois-democratic in
character, since the development of the productive forces and the
proletariat had not yet reached a point where the question of socialism
could be posed.

At a certain point, the process, having reached its limits, had to go
into reverse. Robespierre and his faction struck down the Left wing and
were then cut down themselves. The Thermidorian reactionaries in France
hunted and oppressed the Jacobins, while the masses, worn out by years
of exertion and sacrifice, had begun to fall into passivity and
indifference. The pendulum now swung sharply to the right. But it did
not restore the #emph[Ancien Régime];. The fundamental socio-economic
gains of the Revolution remained. The power of the landed aristocracy
was broken.

The rotten and corrupt Directory was followed by the equally rotten and
corrupt personal dictatorship of Bonaparte. The French bourgeoisie was
terrified of the Jacobins and the Sans-culottes with their egalitarian
and levelling tendencies. But it was even more terrified by the threat
of royalist counterrevolution, which would drive it from power and put
the clock back to pre-1789. The wars continued and there were still
internal revolts by reactionaries. The only way out was to reintroduce
dictatorship, but in the form of military rule. The bourgeoisie was
looking for a Saviour and found one in the person of Napoleon Bonaparte.

With the defeat of Napoleon in the Battle of Waterloo, the last
flickering embers of the fires lit by revolutionary France were
extinguished. A long, grey period settled down on Europe like a thick
coat of suffocating dust. The forces of triumphant reaction seemed
firmly in the saddle. But that was only in appearance. Beneath the
surface, the Mole of Revolution was busy digging the foundations for a
new revolution.

The victory of capitalism in Europe laid the basis for a colossal
upswing of industry, and with it, the strengthening of that class that
is destined to overthrow capitalism and usher in a new and higher stage
of social development -- socialism. Marx and Engels wrote in The
Communist Manifesto:

#quote(block: true)[
  “A spectre is haunting Europe --- the spectre of communism. All the
  powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this
  spectre: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and
  German police-spies.”
]

These words describe the reactionary system that was established by the
Congress of Vienna following the defeat of Napoleon in 1815. It was
intended to eliminate the risk of revolution forever, to exorcise the
spectre of the French Revolution forever. The brutal dictatorship of the
“powers of old Europe” seemed as if it would last forever. But sooner or
later things would turn into their opposite. Beneath the surface of
reaction, new forces were gradually maturing and a new revolutionary
class -- the proletariat -- was stretching its limbs.

The counter-revolution was overthrown by a new revolutionary wave that
swept over Europe in 1848. These revolutions were fought under the
banner of democracy -- the same banner that was raised over the
barricades of Paris in 1789. But everywhere the leading force in the
revolution was not the cowardly, reactionary bourgeoisie but the lineal
descendants of the French Sans-culottes -- the working class, which
inscribed on its banner a new kind of revolutionary ideal, the ideal of
Communism.

The revolutions of 1848-9 were defeated through the cowardice and
treachery of the bourgeoisie and its Liberal representatives. Reaction
ruled once more until 1871, when the heroic proletariat of France
stormed heaven in the Paris Commune, the first time in history that the
working class overthrew the old bourgeois state and began to create a
new kind of state -- a workers' state. That glorious episode only lasted
a few months and was finally drowned in blood. But it left a lasting
heritage and laid the basis for the Russian Revolution of 1917.

= The Russian Revolution

For Marxists, the Bolshevik Revolution was the greatest single event in
human history. Under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party of Lenin and
Trotsky, the working class succeeded in overthrowing its oppressors and
at least begin the task of the socialist transformation of society.

However, the Revolution took place, not in an advanced capitalist
country as Marx had expected, but on the basis of the most frightful
backwardness. To give an approximate idea of the conditions that
confronted the Bolsheviks, in just one year, 1920, six million people
starved to death in Soviet Russia.

Marx and Engels explained long ago that socialism -- a classless society
-- requires the right material conditions in order to exist. The
starting point of socialism must be a higher point of development of the
productive forces than the most advanced capitalist society (the USA for
instance). Only on the basis of a highly developed industry,
agriculture, science and technology, is it possible to guarantee the
conditions for the free development of human beings, starting with a
drastic reduction in the working day. The prior condition for this is
the participation of the working class in the democratic control and
administration of society.

"Between capitalist and communist society," states Marx, "lies the
period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other.
Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the
state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the
proletariat."

As all the greatest Marxist theoreticians explained, the task of the
socialist revolution is to bring the working class to power by smashing
the old capitalist state machine. The latter was the repressive organ
designed to keep the working class in subjection. Marx explained that
this capitalist state, together with its state bureaucracy, cannot serve
the interests of the new power. It has to be done away with. However,
the new state created by the working class would be different from all
previous states in history. Engels described it as a semi-state, a state
designed in such a way that it was destined to disappear.

Engels long ago explained that in any society in which art, science and
government is the monopoly of a minority, that minority will use and
abuse its position in its own interests. Lenin was quick to see the
danger of the bureaucratic degeneration of the Revolution in conditions
of general backwardness. In #emph[State and Revolution];, written in
1917, he worked out a programme on the basis of the experience of the
Paris Commune. Here he explains the basic conditions -- not for
socialism or communism -- but for the first period after the Revolution,
the transitional period between capitalism and socialism. These were:

+ Free and democratic elections and the right of recall for all
  officials.

+ No official to receive a wage higher than a skilled worker.

+ No standing army but the armed people.

+ Gradually, all the tasks of running the state to be carried out in
  turn by the workers: when everybody is a "bureaucrat" in turn, nobody
  is a bureaucrat.

This is a finished programme for workers' democracy. It is directly
aimed against the danger of bureaucracy. This in turn formed the basis
of the 1919 Bolshevik Party Programme. In other words, contrary to the
calumnies of the enemies of socialism, Soviet Russia in the time of
Lenin and Trotsky was the most democratic regime in history.

However, the regime of soviet workers' democracy established by the
October Revolution did not survive. By the early 1930s, all the above
points had been abolished. Under Stalin, the workers' state suffered a
process of bureaucratic degeneration which ended in the establishment of
a monstrous totalitarian regime and the physical annihilation of the
Leninist Party. The decisive factor in the Stalinist political
counter-revolution in Russia was the isolation of the Revolution in a
backward country. The way in which this political counter-revolution
took place was explained by Trotsky in #emph[The Revolution Betrayed];.

It is not feasible for society to jump straight from capitalism to a
classless society. The material and cultural inheritance of capitalist
society is far too inadequate for that. There is too much scarcity and
inequality that cannot be immediately overcome. After the socialist
revolution, there must be a transitional period that will prepare the
necessary ground for superabundance and a classless society.

Marx called this first stage of the new society "the lowest stage of
communism" as opposed to "the highest stage of communism", where the
last residue of material inequality would disappear. In that sense,
socialism and communism have been contrasted to the "lower" and "higher"
stages of the new society.

In describing the lower stage of communism Marx writes: "What we are
dealing with here is a communist society, not as it has developed on its
own foundations, but, on the contrary, just as it emerges from
capitalist society; which is thus in every respect, economically,
morally and intellectually, still stamped with the birth marks of the
old society from whose womb it emerges." (Marx and Engels, Selected
Works, Critique of the Gotha Programme, by Marx, Vol. 3, p.~17. From
here on referred to as MESW.)

However, for Marx -- and this is a crucial point -- this lower stage of
communism from its very beginning would be on a higher level in terms of
its economic development than the most developed and advanced
capitalism. And why was this so important? Because without a massive
development of the productive forces, scarcity would prevail and with it
the struggle for existence.

As Marx and Engels explained, such a state of affairs would pose the
danger of degeneration: "This development of the productive forces is an
absolutely necessary practical premise \[of communism\], because without
it want is generalised, and with want the struggle for necessities
begins again, and that means that all the old crap must revive." (MESW,
The German Ideology, Vol. 1, p. 37, my emphasis)

These prophetic words of Marx explain why the Russian Revolution, so
full of promise, ended in bureaucratic degeneration and the monstrous
totalitarian caricature of Stalinism, which in turn prepared the way for
capitalist restoration and a further regression. “All the old crap”
revived because the Russian Revolution was isolated in conditions of
frightful material and cultural backwardness. But today with the
tremendous advance in science and technique, the conditions have been
prepared whereby this would no longer be the case.

= Unprecedented advance

Every phase of human development has its roots in all previous
development. This is true both of human evolution and social
development. We have evolved from lower species and are genetically
related to even the most primitive life forms, as the human genome has
conclusively proved. We are separated from our nearest living relatives,
the chimpanzees, by a genetic difference of less than two percent. But
that very small percentage represents a tremendous qualitative leap.

We have emerged from savagery, barbarism, slavery and feudalism, and
each of these stages represented a definite stage in the development of
the productive forces and culture. Hegel expressed this idea in a
beautiful passage in the Phenomenology of Mind:

#quote(block: true)[
  “The bud disappears when the blossom breaks through, and we might say
  that the former is refuted by the latter; in the same way when the fruit
  comes, the blossom may be explained to be a false form of the plant's
  existence, for the fruit appears as its true nature in place of the
  blossom. The ceaseless activity of their own inherent nature makes these
  stages moments of an organic unity, where they not merely do not
  contradict one another, but where one is as necessary as the other; and
  constitutes thereby the life of the whole.”
]

Every stage in the development of society is rooted in necessity and
emerges out of the preceding stages. History can only be understood if
these stages are taken in their unity. Each had its raison d'être in the
development of the productive forces, and each entered into
contradiction with their further development at a certain stage, when a
revolution was necessary to cast off the old forms and allow new forms
to emerge.

As we have seen, the victory of the bourgeoisie was achieved by
revolutionary means, although nowadays the defenders of capitalism do
not like to be reminded of the fact. And as Marx explained, the
bourgeoisie, historically, has played a most revolutionary role:

#quote(block: true)[
  “The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionising the
  instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and
  with them the whole relations of society. Conservation of the old modes
  of production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the first
  condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant
  revolutionising of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social
  conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the
  bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones.” (Communist Manifesto)
]

Under capitalism the productive forces have experienced spectacular
development, unprecedented in the history of mankind: despite the fact
that capitalism is the most exploitative and oppressive system that has
ever existed; despite the fact that, in Marx's words, "Capital came onto
the stage of history dripping blood from every pore," it nevertheless
represented a colossal leap forward in the development of the productive
forces -- and therefore of our power over nature.

During the last two centuries the development of technology and science
has proceeded at a far faster rate than in all previous history. The
curve of human development, which was virtually flat for most of our
history, suddenly experienced a steep ascent. The dizzying progress of
technology is the precondition for the final emancipation of humankind,
the abolition of poverty and illiteracy, ignorance, disease and the
domination of nature by man through conscious planning of the economy.
The road is open to conquest, not only on Earth, but in space.

= Capitalism in decline

It is the illusion of every epoch that it will last forever. Every
social system believes that it represents the only possible form of
existence for human beings; that its institutions, its religion, its
morality are the last word that can be spoken. That is what the
cannibals, the Egyptian priests, Marie Antoinette and Tsar Nicholas all
fervently believed. And that is what the bourgeoisie and its apologists
today wish to demonstrate when they assure us, without the slightest
basis, that the so-called system of “free enterprise” is the only
possible system -- just when it is beginning to show all the signs of
senile decay.

The capitalist system today resembles the Sorcerer's Apprentice who
conjured up powerful forces which he could not control. The fundamental
contradiction of capitalist society is the antagonism between the social
nature of production and the private form of appropriation. From this
central contradiction many others arise. This contradiction is expressed
by periodic crises, as Marx explains:

#quote(block: true)[
  “In these crises, a great part not only of the existing products, but
  also of the previously created productive forces, are periodically
  destroyed. In these crises, there breaks out an epidemic that, in all
  earlier epochs, would have seemed an absurdity --- the epidemic of
  overproduction. Society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of
  momentary barbarism; it appears as if a famine, a universal war of
  devastation, had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence;
  industry and commerce seem to be destroyed; and why? Because there is
  too much civilisation, too much means of subsistence, too much industry,
  too much commerce. The productive forces at the disposal of society no
  longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois
  property; on the contrary, they have become too powerful for these
  conditions, by which they are fettered, and so soon as they overcome
  these fetters, they bring disorder into the whole of bourgeois society,
  endanger the existence of bourgeois property. The conditions of
  bourgeois society are too narrow to comprise the wealth created by them.
  And how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises? On the one hand by
  enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces; on the other, by
  the conquest of new markets, and by the more thorough exploitation of
  the old ones. That is to say, by paving the way for more extensive and
  more destructive crises, and by diminishing the means whereby crises are
  prevented.” (The Communist Manifesto)
]

This is an exact description of the present situation. It is a terrible
paradox that the more humanity develops its productive capacity, the
more spectacular the advances of science and technology, the greater the
suffering, starvation, oppression and misery of the majority of the
world's population. The sickness of capitalism on a world scale
manifested itself in the collapse of 2008. This was the beginning of the
biggest crisis in the entire 200 year existence of capitalism, and it is
far from being resolved. This is an expression of the impasse of
capitalism, which in the last analysis is a result of the revolt of the
productive forces against the straitjacket of private property and the
nation state.

= Socialism or barbarism

For thousands of years culture has been the monopoly of a privileged
minority, while the great majority of humanity was excluded from
knowledge, science, art and government. Even now, this remains the case.
Despite all our pretensions, we are not really civilised. The world we
live in now certainly does not merit the name. It is a barbaric world,
inhabited by people who have yet to overcome a barbarous past. Life
remains a harsh and unrelenting struggle to exist for the great majority
of the planet, not only in the underdeveloped world but in the developed
capitalist countries as well.

Engels pointed out that there were two possibilities before the human
race: socialism or barbarism. The question is therefore posed in the
starkest terms: in the coming period, either the working class will take
into its hands the running of society, replacing the decrepit capitalist
system with a new social order based on the harmonious and rational
planning of the productive forces and the conscious control of men and
women over their own lives and destinies, or else we will be faced with
a most frightful spectacle of social, economic and cultural collapse.

The crisis of capitalism represents not just an economic crisis that
threatens the jobs and living standards of millions of people throughout
the world. It also threatens the very basis of a civilised existence --
insofar as this exists. It threatens to throw humankind back on all
fronts. If the proletariat -- the only genuinely revolutionary class --
does not succeed in overthrowing the rule of the banks and monopolies,
the stage will be set for a collapse of culture and even a return to
barbarism.

= Consciousness

Dialectics teaches us that sooner or later, things change into their
opposite. It is possible to draw parallels between geology and society.
Just as the tectonic plates, having moved too slowly, compensate the
delay by a violent earthquake, so the lagging of consciousness behind
events is compensated by sudden changes in the psychology of the masses.
The most striking manifestation of dialectics is the crisis of
capitalism itself. Dialectics are taking their revenge on the
bourgeoisie who have understood nothing, predicted nothing and are
capable of solving nothing.

The collapse of the Soviet Union created a mood of pessimism and despair
amongst the working class. The defenders of capitalism launched a
ferocious ideological counteroffensive against the ideas of socialism
and Marxism. They promised us a future of peace, prosperity and
democracy thanks to the wonders of the free market economy. Two decades
have passed since then and a decade is not such a long time in the grand
scheme of history. Not one stone upon another now remains of these
comforting illusions.

Everywhere there are wars, unemployment, poverty and hunger. And
everywhere a new spirit of revolt is arising and people are looking for
ideas that can explain what is happening in the world. The old, stable,
peaceful, prosperous capitalism is dead, and with it the old peaceful,
harmonious relations between the classes. The future will be one of
years and decades of austerity, unemployment and falling living
standards. That is a finished recipe for a revival of the class struggle
everywhere.

The embryo of a new society is already maturing within the womb of the
old. The elements of a workers' democracy already exist in the form of
the workers' organisations, the shop stewards committees, the trade
unions, the cooperatives etc. In the period that opens up, there will be
a life and death struggle -- a struggle of those elements of the new
society to be born, and an equally fierce resistance on the part of the
old order to prevent this from happening.

It is true that the consciousness of the masses has been lagging far
behind events. But that also will change into its opposite. Great events
are forcing men and women to question their old beliefs and assumptions.
They are being jolted out of the old supine, apathetic indifference and
forced to come to terms with reality. We can already see this in outline
with the events in Greece. In such periods consciousness can change very
rapidly. And that is just what a revolution is.

The rise of modern capitalism and of its gravedigger, the working class,
has made much clearer what is at the heart of the materialist conception
of history. Our task is not merely to understand but bring to a
successful conclusion the historic struggle of the classes by means of
the victory of the proletariat and the socialist transformation of
society. Capitalism has failed after all to “end” history. The task of
Marxists is to work actively to hasten the overthrow of the old,
decrepit system and help to bring about the birth of a new and better
world.

= From necessity to freedom

The scientific approach to history that historical materialism gives us
does not incline us to draw pessimistic conclusions from the horrific
symptoms of decline that confront us on all sides. On the contrary, the
general tendency of human history has been in the direction of ever
greater development of our productive and cultural potential.

The relation between the development of human culture and the productive
forces was already clear to that great genius of antiquity, Aristotle,
who explained in his book, #emph[The Metaphysics,] that~ philosophy
began “when practically all the necessities of life were already
supplied”, and added that the reason why astronomy and mathematics were
discovered in Egypt is that the priest caste did not have to work. This
is a purely materialist understanding of history.

The great achievements of the last hundred years have for the first time
created a situation where all the problems facing humankind can easily
be solved. The potential for a classless society already exists on a
world scale. What is necessary is to bring about a rational and
harmonious planning of the productive forces in order that this immense,
practically infinite, potential can be realised.

Once the productive forces are freed from the straitjacket of
capitalism, the potential exists to produce a great number of geniuses:
artists, writers, composers, philosophers, scientists and architects.
Art, science and culture would flower as never before. This rich,
beautiful and wonderfully diverse world would at last become a place fit
for human beings to live in.

In a certain sense socialist society is a return to primitive tribal
communism but on a vastly higher productive level. Before one can
envisage a classless society, all the hallmarks of class society,
especially inequality and scarcity, would have to be abolished. It would
be absurd to talk of the abolition of classes where inequality, scarcity
and the struggle for existence prevailed. It would be a contradiction in
terms. Socialism can only appear at a certain stage in the evolution of
human society, at a certain level of development of the productive
forces.

On the basis of a real revolution in production, it would be possible to
achieve such a level of abundance that men and women would no longer
have to worry about their everyday necessities. The humiliating concerns
and fears that fill every thinking hour of men and women now will
disappear. For the first time, free human beings will be masters of
their destinies. For the first time they will be really human. Only then
will the real history of the human race begin.

On the basis of a harmonious planned economy in which the tremendous
productive power of science and technology will be harnessed for the
satisfaction of human needs, not the profits of a few, culture will
reach new and undreamed-of levels of development. The Romans described
slaves as “tools with voices”. Nowadays we do not need to enslave people
to do the work. We already have the technology to create robots that can
not only play chess and perform elementary tasks on production lines but
drive vehicles more safely than humans and even carry out quite complex
tasks.

On the basis of capitalism, this technology threatens to displace
millions of workers: not only lorry drivers and unskilled workers but
people like accountants and computer programmers are threatened with
losing their livelihoods. Millions will be thrown on the scrapheap while
those who retain their jobs will be working longer hours than before.

In a socialist planned economy, the same technology would be used to
reduce the working day. We could immediately introduce a thirty hour
week, followed by a twenty hour week, a ten hour week or even less,
while increasing production and expanding the wealth of society far more
than what is conceivable under capitalism.

This would represent a fundamental change in people's lives. For the
first time, men and women would be freed from the drudgery of labour.
They would be free to develop themselves physically, mentally and one
might even add spiritually. Men and women will be free to lift their
eyes to the heavens and contemplate the stars.

Trotsky once wrote: “How many Aristotles are herding swine? And how many
swineherds are sitting on thrones?” Class society impoverishes people,
not just materially but psychologically. The lives of millions of human
beings are confined to the narrowest limits. Their mental horizons are
stunted. Socialism would release all the colossal potential that is
being wasted by capitalism.

It is true that people have different characters and aptitudes. Not
everyone can be an Aristotle, a Beethoven or an Einstein. But everybody
has the potential to do great things in one field or another, to become
a great scientist, artist, musician, dancer or footballer. Communism
will provide all the conditions needed to develop those potentials to
the fullest extent.

This would be the greatest revolution of all time. It would carry human
civilisation to a new and qualitatively superior level. In the words of
Engels it would be humankind's leap from the realm of necessity to the
realm of true freedom.
